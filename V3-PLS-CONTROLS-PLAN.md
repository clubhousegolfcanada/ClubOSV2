# V3-PLS Practical System Controls

## Actually Useful Controls for Better Auto-Responses

### 1. Response Timing Control
**Purpose**: Prevent instant bot-like responses that feel unnatural
- **Human Delay**: Add 3-8 second delay before auto-response
- **Typing Indicator**: Show "typing..." for realistic feel
- **Why Useful**: Customers trust responses that don't feel automated

### 2. Context Awareness Settings
**Purpose**: Make responses more relevant to time/situation
- **Business Hours Mode**: Different responses for after-hours
  - During hours: "Someone will help you right away"
  - After hours: "We'll get back to you first thing tomorrow"
- **Location Context**: Include which location in responses
- **Previous Conversation Memory**: Reference earlier messages
- **Why Useful**: Responses feel personalized, not generic

### 3. Confidence Thresholds
**Purpose**: Control when system should auto-respond vs wait for operator
- **Auto-Execute Threshold**: Only auto-send if 85%+ confident
- **Suggest-Only Threshold**: Show suggestion to operator if 60-85%
- **Escalation Trigger**: Auto-notify operator for certain keywords
  - "angry", "lawyer", "refund", "injured", "emergency"
- **Why Useful**: Prevents bad auto-responses, catches important issues

### 4. Response Enhancement
**Purpose**: Make automated responses more helpful
- **Include Links**: Auto-add booking link, hours page, etc.
- **Add Contact Options**: "Or call us at..." for urgent issues
- **Follow-up Questions**: "Did this answer your question?"
- **Why Useful**: Reduces back-and-forth, gives customers options

### 5. Learning Controls
**Purpose**: Improve patterns over time
- **Minimum Examples**: Need 5+ similar Q&As before creating pattern
- **Operator Override Priority**: If operator corrects, weight that heavily
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Different responses for summer/winter
- **Why Useful**: System gets smarter, fewer mistakes

### 6. Safety Controls
**Purpose**: Prevent embarrassing or harmful auto-responses
- **Blacklist Topics**: Never auto-respond about:
  - Medical emergencies
  - Legal issues
  - Complaints about staff
  - Refund requests
- **Double-Check Mode**: For new patterns, require operator approval for first 10 uses
- **Why Useful**: Protects business reputation

### 7. Analytics Settings
**Purpose**: Track what's actually working
- **Success Tracking**: Did customer stop messaging after auto-response?
- **Escalation Rate**: How often do auto-responses lead to operator takeover?
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Quick thumbs up/down after auto-response
- **Why Useful**: Know what to improve or disable

## What NOT to Include

### Overly Complex Settings
- ❌ AI personality adjustments
- ❌ Tone sliders (formal/casual)
- ❌ Response length controls
- ❌ Multiple language models

### Features That Don't Help
- ❌ Response templates library (patterns already do this)
- ❌ Manual pattern creation (learns from real responses)
- ❌ Complex routing rules (keep it simple)

## Implementation Priority

1. **Confidence Thresholds** - Most important for quality control
2. **Business Hours Mode** - Immediate practical value
3. **Human Delay** - Easy win for natural feel
4. **Blacklist Topics** - Critical for safety
5. **Success Tracking** - Measure effectiveness

## UI Design

Simple toggles and sliders, grouped by purpose:
- Safety Settings (top priority, red accent)
- Quality Controls (confidence, delays)
- Enhancement Options (links, follow-ups)
- Learning Settings (when to create patterns)

Each setting should show:
- Current value
- Impact indicator (how many messages affected)
- Last changed date
- Reset to default option
