## üö® Critical Path Items

These MUST be done first:
1. **Run GPT-4 upgrade script** - Without this, patterns are useless
2. **Implement variable replacement** - Required for dynamic responses
3. **Add semantic matching** - Required for practical match rates
4. **Enable confidence evolution** - Required for automation decisions

## üìù Notes for Next Session

When you start the new context window:
1. Begin with running the GPT-4 upgrade script on Railway
2. Check the results - confirm patterns have templates
3. Implement variable replacement
4. Test with real messages
5. Move to semantic matching

Key files to focus on:
- `/src/services/patternLearningService.ts` - Core logic
- `/src/routes/openphone.ts` - Message processing
- `/scripts/upgrade-patterns-gpt4.ts` - Pattern upgrade
- `/src/routes/patterns.ts` - API endpoints

Environment requirements:
- Must have OpenAI API key configured
- Must run upgrade script where OpenAI is available
- Need database access for pattern updates

## üí° Remember

The goal is not perfection, but practical automation that:
- Reduces operator workload by 60-80%
- Learns from every interaction
- Gets better over time
- Always allows human override

Start conservative, build confidence through success.
