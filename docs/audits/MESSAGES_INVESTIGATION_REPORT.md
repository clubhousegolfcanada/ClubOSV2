# Messages System Investigation Report
Date: September 15, 2025

## Executive Summary
The messages system is partially working but has critical issues preventing new messages from appearing in the UI.

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Database has messages**: 123 total conversations with 735 messages stored
2. **OpenPhone API is configured**: Health check confirms OpenPhone is connected
3. **Backend is running**: Railway deployment is live at `clubosv2-production.up.railway.app`
4. **Frontend can authenticate**: Users can log in and access the messages page
5. **Messages endpoint works**: `/api/messages/conversations` returns data when properly authenticated

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
1. **No new messages since Sept 13**: Last message received was 2 days ago
2. **Webhook not receiving data**: No new OpenPhone webhooks being processed
3. **Split conversation issue (FIXED)**: Messages were creating duplicate conversations instead of appending

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Webhook Configuration Issue (PRIMARY)
**Problem**: OpenPhone is not sending webhooks to our endpoint
**Evidence**:
- No new messages in database after Sept 13
- Only 2 conversations created on Sept 13, none after
- You mentioned 6 new messages but they're not in the database

**Required Action**:
- Verify webhook URL in OpenPhone dashboard is set to: `https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook`
- Check webhook secret matches: `TmM4aFZrdDk1UEdUYURDZEVja3g3aWtGUTlsTXYyVnY=`

### 2. Split Conversations Bug (FIXED)
**Problem**: New messages were creating new conversation records instead of appending
**Fix Applied**: Updated webhook handlers to use correct database ID when updating
**Status**: Deployed to production in commit `9edde0f`

### 3. NaN Error in Usage Tracking (FIXED)
**Problem**: Invalid response times causing database insert failures
**Fix Applied**: Added validation to handle NaN values
**Status**: Deployed to production in commit `6ff8639`

## Database Analysis

### Current Message Distribution:
```
Top Conversations by Message Count:
+19022929623 (Faris Elshanti)    - 24 messages (last: Sept 13)
+19024408522 (Hwiseong Ahn)      - 11 messages (last: Sept 12)
+19028090981 (Rob Walker)         - 11 messages (last: Sept 12)
+14167124793 (Unknown)           - 10 messages (last: Sept 11)
```

### Message Storage Format:
Messages are stored as JSONB array with structure:
```json
{
  "id": "message_id",
  "to": "+phone",
  "from": "+phone",
  "body": "message text",
  "direction": "inbound/outbound",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "conversationId": "conv_id"
}
```

## System Architecture

### Message Flow:
1. **OpenPhone** → Sends webhook to Railway backend
2. **Railway Backend** → Processes webhook, stores in PostgreSQL
3. **PostgreSQL** → Stores in `openphone_conversations` table
4. **Frontend (Vercel)** → Queries `/api/messages/conversations`
5. **UI** → Displays conversations and messages

### Webhook Endpoints Available:
- Main: `https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook`
- V3: `https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone-v3/webhook-v3`
- Debug: `https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook-debug`

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Verify OpenPhone Webhook Configuration
```
1. Log into OpenPhone dashboard
2. Go to Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
3. Verify webhook URL is: https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook
4. Verify webhook secret matches the one in Railway env vars
5. Check webhook is enabled and active
6. Test by sending a test message
```

### 2. Monitor Webhook Reception
```bash
# Watch Railway logs for webhook activity
railway logs -f | grep -i "webhook\|openphone"
```

### 3. Test Webhook Manually
```bash
# Send test webhook to debug endpoint
curl -X POST https://clubosv2-production.up.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook-debug \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"message.received","data":{"from":"+1234567890","body":"Test message"}}'
```

## Fixes Already Applied

### 1. Webhook Message Appending (Deployed)
- Fixed `updateOpenPhoneConversation` to use correct database ID
- Messages now append to existing conversations instead of creating duplicates
- Files modified: `openphone.ts`, `openphone-v3.ts`

### 2. NaN Error Handling (Deployed)
- Added validation for `response_time_ms` field
- Prevents PostgreSQL type errors
- File modified: `usageTrackingService.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Verify OpenPhone webhook configuration** (Most Critical)
2. **Monitor Railway logs for incoming webhooks**
3. **Test with a real message to verify flow**
4. **Check if messages appear in UI after webhook is fixed**

## Conclusion

The core system is functional, but OpenPhone webhooks are not reaching the backend. This is why no new messages have appeared since September 13. Once the webhook configuration is verified and corrected in the OpenPhone dashboard, messages should flow through the system properly.

The code fixes for message appending and NaN errors have been deployed and will ensure proper message handling once webhooks resume.
