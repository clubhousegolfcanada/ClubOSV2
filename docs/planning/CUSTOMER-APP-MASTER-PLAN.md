# Customer App Master Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a customer-facing mobile app for ClubOS with social features, bookings, and integrations. Claude will handle all programming while you guide strategic decisions.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Approach
- **Base**: ClubOS V1 (complete features, TypeScript, production-tested)
- **Patterns**: Adopt V3's architecture (action framework, confidence routing, pattern learning)
- **Deployment**: Unified system with role-based access (not a separate fork)
- **Mobile**: React Native for iOS/Android (not just PWA)
- **Backend**: Extend existing V1 with customer endpoints

## 4-Week Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-5)
**Goal**: Database, authentication, and API structure

### Week 2: Core Features (Days 6-10)  
**Goal**: Bookings, events, social features

### Week 3: Mobile App (Days 11-15)
**Goal**: React Native app with push notifications

### Week 4: Integration & Launch (Days 16-20)
**Goal**: TrackMan, HubSpot, testing, deployment

- `team_members` - Team membership
- `events` - Tournaments/events
- `event_participants` - Event registration
- `booking_shares` - Shared bookings
- `activity_feed` - Social activity

### V3 Patterns to Implement

#### 1. Confidence-Based Responses
```typescript
// For customer service automation
interface CustomerResponse {
  message: string;
  confidence: number;
  needsHumanReview: boolean;
  suggestedActions?: Action[];
}

// Route based on confidence
if (confidence >= 0.95) {
  sendAutoResponse();
} else if (confidence >= 0.75) {
  queueForReview();
} else {
  escalateToStaff();
}
```

#### 2. Action Framework
```typescript
// Unified handler for customer actions
class CustomerActionHandler extends BaseHandler {
  async execute(action: CustomerAction) {
    // Validate
    // Execute with retry
    // Log result
    // Learn from outcome
  }
}
```

#### 3. Pattern Learning
```typescript
// Learn from customer interactions
class CustomerPatternLearning {
  async recordInteraction(interaction: Interaction) {
    // Store pattern
    // Update confidence
    // Improve future responses
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Skedda API limitations** → Build abstraction layer
2. **TrackMan unavailable** → Manual stats entry fallback
3. **App store rejection** → Have fixes ready
4. **Performance issues** → Caching and optimization

### Business Risks:
1. **Low adoption** → Marketing plan ready
2. **Feature creep** → Stick to MVP scope
3. **Support overload** → Self-service features
4. **Data privacy concerns** → Clear privacy policy

## Daily Workflow

Each day I will:
1. **Morning**: Review plan, ask for decisions needed
2. **Implementation**: Write code, frequent commits
3. **Testing**: Test as I go, document issues
4. **Update**: Show progress, get feedback
5. **Planning**: Prepare for next day

You will:
1. **Decisions**: Answer questions as they arise
2. **Feedback**: Review progress and suggest changes
3. **Testing**: Try features as they're built
4. **Priority**: Adjust priorities if needed

## Ready to Start?

Once you've reviewed this plan and made the immediate decisions, we can begin Day 1 implementation. I'll create the database migrations and start building the foundation.

**First decisions needed:**
1. App name for branding?
2. Confirm Skedda for bookings?
3. Is 4-week timeline acceptable?
4. Who will be beta testers?

Let me know when you're ready to begin!
