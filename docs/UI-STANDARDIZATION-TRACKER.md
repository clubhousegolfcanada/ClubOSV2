# UI Standardization Implementation Tracker
**Started**: September 7, 2025  
**Goal**: Make ClubOS white-label ready while keeping #0B3D3A as current brand color  
**Approach**: Clean up as we go, document everything, use existing infrastructure

## Current State Audit (September 7, 2025)

### ✅ What We Have
- [x] CSS Variable system in `globals.css` with `--accent: #1a4040` (dark) and `--accent: #152f2f` (light)
- [x] ThemeContext for dark/light mode switching
- [x] Start of UI component library (`/components/ui/Button.tsx`)
- [x] White Label Planner module (v1.18.0)

### ❌ What Needs Fixing
- [ ] 97 hardcoded #0B3D3A colors across customer pages
- [ ] Button component has hardcoded colors instead of CSS variables
- [ ] No brand configuration system
- [ ] Missing shared components (cards, badges, loaders)
- [ ] Duplicate code in booking/location logic

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: CSS Variable Migration ✅ COMPLETED (September 7, 2025)
**Goal**: Replace all hardcoded colors with CSS variables while keeping #0B3D3A

#### Step 1.1: Update CSS Variables to Use Our Brand Color
- [x] Update `globals.css` to set `--accent: #0B3D3A` 
- [x] Update hover state `--accent-hover: #084a45`
- [x] Document the change

#### Step 1.2: Fix Button Component
- [x] Replace hardcoded `#0B3D3A` with `var(--accent)`
- [x] Replace hardcoded `#094A3F` with `var(--accent-hover)`
- [x] Test component still looks correct

#### Step 1.3: Migrate Customer Pages
**Files Updated** (97 hardcoded colors eliminated):
- [x] `/customer/compete.tsx` - 16 instances migrated
- [x] `/customer/profile.tsx` - 38 instances migrated
- [x] `/customer/challenges/create.tsx` - 27 instances migrated
- [x] `/customer/challenges/[id].tsx` - 13 instances migrated
- [x] `/customer/events.tsx` - 3 instances migrated
- [x] `/customer/bookings.tsx` - 1 instance migrated
- [x] `/customer/leaderboard.tsx` - 1 instance migrated
- [x] `/customer/index.tsx` - 1 instance migrated
- [x] `/customer/challenges/index.tsx` - 1 instance migrated

### Phase 2: Component Library (Next)
- [ ] Create shared BookingCard component
- [ ] Create shared LocationSelector component
- [ ] Create shared StatusBadge component
- [ ] Create shared LoadingSpinner component
- [ ] Update pages to use shared components

### Phase 3: Brand Configuration (Future)
- [ ] Add environment variables for brand name
- [ ] Add environment variables for URLs
- [ ] Create brand config loader
- [ ] Update navigation with dynamic branding

## Migration Script Commands
```bash
# To find remaining hardcoded colors:
grep -r "#0B3D3A\|#084a45" ClubOSV1-frontend/src/pages/customer

# To count instances per file:
grep -c "#0B3D3A\|#084a45" [filename]

# After migration, verify CSS variable usage:
grep -r "var(--accent)" ClubOSV1-frontend/src/pages/customer
```

## Implementation Breadcrumbs
Creating a clear trail for future developers:

1. **Why we're doing this**: Enable white-labeling while maintaining current brand
2. **What we're changing**: Hardcoded colors → CSS variables
3. **What stays the same**: Visual appearance (#0B3D3A remains the color)
4. **How to change brand later**: Update CSS variables in globals.css
5. **Where to find components**: `/components/ui/` for shared components
