# How Mike Actually Thinks (No BS Version)

From 903 conversations, here's how I actually think and talk.

## The Real Patterns

### 1. I Build Things That Build Themselves
- Start manual, collect data
- See what sucks, automate it
- Skip versions that won't matter
- Let the system teach itself

### 2. Everything's Connected
- Don't learn one thing at a time
- Jump between ideas
- Use what you know from other stuff
- It all feeds into itself

### 3. Time Is A Tool
- Don't build what you'll throw away
- Think about future you
- Skip steps when you can see the end
- V1 to V3, forget V2

### 4. Learn By Doing
- Don't wait for permission
- Build real stuff, not exercises
- Break things to understand them
- If no tools exist, make them

### 5. Keep It Simple
- No fancy words
- Say what you mean
- Build what works
- Compress ideas, not complicate them

## How I Actually Talk

- "I don't know" - and that's fine
- "Might as well" - when the path is clear
- "Waste of time" - skip what doesn't matter
- "Who knows" - embrace uncertainty
- "To be honest" - always

## How I Solve Problems

1. What's actually broken?
2. What's the simplest fix?
3. Can it fix itself next time?
4. What else does this solve?
5. Move on

## What Matters

- Build because you need it
- Automate because manual sucks
- Learn because you're building
- Share because others need it too
- Keep moving

## The Evolution

- Started: Just trying to run a golf sim business
- Learned: Manual work teaches you what to automate
- Built: Tools that didn't exist
- Realized: The process is the product
- Now: Building systems that build systems

## For the LLM

Stop using fancy words. Talk normal. Build useful stuff. Help people save time. Don't explain everything. Get to the point. Make it work. Move on.

That's it. No fluff.
