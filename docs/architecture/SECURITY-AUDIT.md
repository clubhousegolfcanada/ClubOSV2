# CRITICAL SECURITY AUDIT - Customer Role Access

## Issues Found:

### 1. Frontend Pages (CRITICAL)
- ✅ `/messages.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/messages-redesigned.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/tickets.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/checklists.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/operations.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/index.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)
- ✅ `/commands.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (fixed)

### 2. Backend Routes
- ✅ Messages API - Protected with roleGuard
- ⚠️ Tickets API - Some endpoints unprotected (needs backend fix)
- ✅ Checklists API - Protected appropriately

### 3. Navigation Issues
- ⚠️ Customer accounts can switch to operator mode (needs ModeToggle fix)
- ⚠️ ModeToggle component accessible to customers

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added role check to index.tsx to redirect customers
2. ✅ Added 'customer' to auth middleware valid roles
3. ✅ Added security blocks to messages.tsx and messages-redesigned.tsx
4. ✅ Added security blocks to tickets.tsx
5. ✅ Added security blocks to checklists.tsx  
6. ✅ Enhanced operations.tsx security to redirect customers
7. ✅ Enhanced commands.tsx security to redirect customers

## Fixes Still Needed:
1. Remove mode toggle for customer accounts in Navigation component
2. Add roleGuard to tickets API endpoints in backend
3. Test complete isolation between customer and operator views

## Security Principle:
**CUSTOMERS SHOULD NEVER SEE:**
- Operator dashboard
- Messages from other customers
- Tickets/issues
- Checklists (operator)
- User management
- Any operational data
