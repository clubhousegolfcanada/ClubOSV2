Hi Branden! Great question.

We kind of do... that's not a good answer though... Last year we had a monthly fee that could be cancelled at any time to get 50% off. We are still taking suggestions from everyone before the winter season to find what makes the most sense. We made it so anyone that had the 50% off and kept it all year didn't pay from May until November, and they kept the 50% off this summer... so some of them are going right now for $10 an hour.

We didn't want to sell packages last year as we heard many places were oversold and nobody could use their time, and it was a bad experience. As you go to a Clubhouse more often, you get further future booking windows and other benefits for free.

Open to any suggestions though!
