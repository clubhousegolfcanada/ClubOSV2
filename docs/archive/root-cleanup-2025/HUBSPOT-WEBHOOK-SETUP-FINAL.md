# HubSpot Booking Rewards - Final Setup Steps

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: CODE COMPLETE - AWAITING CONFIGURATION

### What's Already Done
1. ‚úÖ **Database**: `booking_rewards` table created in production
2. ‚úÖ **Backend Code**: All webhook endpoints deployed and live
3. ‚úÖ **Processing Job**: Hourly job running to award rewards
4. ‚úÖ **Admin Tools**: Monitoring endpoints available
5. ‚úÖ **Webhook Routes**: Mounted at `/api/webhooks/hubspot/*`

### Webhook Endpoints (Live Now)
- **Booking Completed**: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed`
- **Booking Updated**: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-updated`

## üîß Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Generate Webhook Secret
```bash
# Run this command to generate a secure secret
openssl rand -hex 32

# Example output (DO NOT USE THIS - generate your own):
# a3f2d8e9c1b5a7d3e9f2c8b4a6d2e8f4c1b3a5d7e9f1c3b5a7d9e1f3c5b7a9d1
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Railway
1. Open [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your backend service (ClubOSV1-backend)
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add these variables:
   ```
   HUBSPOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET = [paste generated secret from Step 1]
   BOOKING_REWARD_AMOUNT = 25
   BOOKING_REWARD_DELAY_DAYS = 7
   ```
5. Click "Add" and wait for redeploy (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Configure HubSpot Webhooks

#### Option A: Using HubSpot Private App (Recommended)
1. Go to HubSpot ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Private Apps
2. Find or create "ClubOS Integration" app
3. Go to "Webhooks" tab
4. Click "Create subscription"
5. Configure webhook:
   - **Object type**: Deal
   - **Event type**: Property change
   - **Property to monitor**: `dealstage`
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed`
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
   - **Authentication**: Add header `X-HubSpot-Signature` with webhook secret

#### Option B: Using HubSpot Workflows (Alternative)
1. Go to HubSpot ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Workflows
2. Create new workflow "Booking Rewards"
3. Set trigger: Deal stage = Closed Won
4. Add action: Webhook
5. Configure:
   - **URL**: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Body**: Include deal properties (booking_date, contact_id, location)

### Step 4: Test the Integration

#### Quick Test with cURL
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint (no auth required for testing)
curl -X POST https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-HubSpot-Signature: test" \
  -d '[{
    "objectId": "test-deal-001",
    "properties": {
      "dealstage": "closedwon",
      "booking_date": "2025-08-24",
      "location": "Bedford",
      "box_number": "2",
      "contact_id": "test-contact-123"
    }
  }]'

# Expected response:
# {"success":true}
```

#### Verify in Admin Panel
1. Check pending rewards:
   ```
   GET https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-rewards/pending
   ```

2. View statistics:
   ```
   GET https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-rewards/stats
   ```

### Step 5: Monitor First Real Booking
1. Create a test booking in HubSpot (or wait for real booking)
2. Check webhook logs in HubSpot for delivery status
3. Monitor Railway logs: `railway logs`
4. Check pending rewards in admin panel
5. After 7 days, verify CC awarded to customer

## üìä How It Works

```
Customer Books ‚Üí HubSpot Deal Closed ‚Üí Webhook Fired ‚Üí ClubOS Queues Reward
                                                           ‚Üì (7 days later)
                                                     Hourly Job Awards 25 CC
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook not firing
- Check HubSpot webhook logs for errors
- Verify webhook URL is exactly as shown above
- Ensure deal stage is changing to "closedwon"

### Issue: User not found
- Customer must have ClubOS account before booking
- Check if customer email/phone matches between systems
- May need to manually link HubSpot contact ID

### Issue: Rewards not processing
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs | grep booking`
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check job is running: Look for "Processing booking rewards" in logs

### Issue: Double rewards
- System prevents this automatically (unique constraint)
- Check `booking_rewards` table for duplicates

## üìà Success Metrics
- **Target**: 100% of completed bookings get rewards
- **Processing time**: Within 1 hour of reward date
- **Error rate**: <5% (usually missing user accounts)

## üö® Emergency Controls
```bash
# Stop all reward processing
# Remove BOOKING_REWARD_AMOUNT from Railway variables

# Manually award a reward (need auth token)
curl -X POST https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-rewards/award/[reward-id] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"

# Cancel a pending reward
curl -X POST https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-rewards/cancel/[reward-id] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
```
