Hi Branden, great question!

We do offer membership options, though we're actively refining our approach based on member feedback. Here's what we currently have:

**Current Offering:**
- Last year, we introduced a monthly membership with 50% off hourly rates (cancelable anytime)
- Members who maintained their membership year-round received May-November free
- Some loyal members are currently playing for just $10/hour

**Why We Don't Sell Packages:**
We've intentionally avoided selling prepaid packages after hearing about overselling issues at other facilities, where members couldn't book time despite having paid in advance. Instead, we reward frequent visitors with:
- Extended advance booking windows
- Additional member benefits at no extra cost

**We Want Your Input:**
As we plan for the winter season, we're actively collecting suggestions from our community. We'd love to hear what membership structure would work best for you!

Let me know if you have any ideas or questions.
