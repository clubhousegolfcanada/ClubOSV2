- ✅ Updated all foreign key constraints to reference lowercase table
- ✅ Standardized column names to snake_case (created_at, updated_at, etc.)

### 2. Code Updates (25 files modified)
- ✅ Updated all SQL queries from `"Users"` to `users`
- ✅ Changed column references from camelCase to snake_case
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript interfaces to match database schema
- ✅ Updated all service files and route handlers

### 3. Files Modified
Backend files updated:

### 4. Verification
