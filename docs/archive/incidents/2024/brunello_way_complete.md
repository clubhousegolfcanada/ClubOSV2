# Brunello/WAY Tournament Sponsorship Incident - Complete Documentation

## Executive Summary
Clubhouse was removed as hole sponsor < 1 month before WAY charity tournament due to Brunello Golf Course claiming "business conflict." Despite insulting alternative offers and poor handling by WAY board, Clubhouse maintained professionalism, kept donation to charity, and won the tournament wearing branded gear.

## Timeline

### Background
- **8 years ago**: Alanna (Clubhouse) co-founded WAY (We Are Young) charity, served on board
- **Previous year**: Clubhouse successfully sponsored hole, gave away free sim hours
- **Early 2025**: Among first companies to sign up, paid for hole sponsorship + team entry

### Incident Progression
- **Aug 12, 2025 10:31 AM**: Marie Boccabella (WAY) notifies Mike about Brunello's objection
  - Claims "direct competition" with their simulator
  - Admits this was allegedly discussed with GM last year but never communicated
  - Offers to return difference or continue with just signage

- **Aug 12, 2025 3:49 PM**: Mike proposes solution
  - Convert hole sponsorship money to increase 1st place prize
  - Clubhouse would donate separately if winner doesn't donate
  - Requests email announcement about prize increase
  - Asks about changing team players
  - Notes branded prizes already ordered for tournament

- **Aug 14, 2025**: Marie confirms player changes allowed up to tournament day

- **Aug 18, 2025 8:18 AM**: Marie presents WAY's alternatives
  - No cash prize available (1st place gets Brunello rounds)
  - Offers "Most Honest Team" award (worst team) - requires MORE payment
  - Suggests placing gifts on carts
  - Offers to include vouchers in final email

- **Aug 18, 2025 9:20 AM**: Mike's response
  - Points out cart gifts contradict hole restriction logic
  - Declines "Most Honest Team" as tone-deaf given honesty issues
  - States Clubhouse won't attend but team will play with merch
  - Confirms end of future tournament participation

- **Aug 18, 2025 12:56 PM**: WAY attempts damage control
  - Katie + Marie offer refund
  - Claim they must comply or risk entire event
  - Request confirmation on team participation
  - Ask about 5 simulator passes for auction

- **Aug 18, 2025 1:15 PM**: Mike maintains high road
  - Refuses refund - "Consider it a separate donation"
  - Confirms team will still play

- **Aug 18, 2025 2:39-3:07 PM**: Final confirmations
  - Mike confirms providing 5 simulator passes
  - Agrees to send them with team

- **Tournament Day**: Clubhouse team wins championship

## Key Players

### WAY (We Are Young)
- **Marie Boccabella**: Wish Director, primary contact
- **Katie**: Co-signatory on damage control email
- **Board**: No longer includes Alanna, poor decision-making

### Clubhouse Representatives
- **Mike (Michael Belair)**: Primary negotiator, maintained professionalism
- **Alanna**: WAY co-founder, former board member
- **Nick, Dylan, Jason, Nan**: BCC'd on communications

### Winning Tournament Team
- **Graeme Burke**: River Oaks Golf Club GM, former professional
- **Justin Burke**: Top Clubhouse golfer
- **Jordan Ells**: Current amateur, Trackman rep (supplies Brunello)
- **4th player**: Elite putter from River Oaks

### Other
- **Brunello Golf Course**: Tournament venue, initiated conflict
- **Brunello GM**: Made original objection (allegedly last year)

## The Actual Issue vs. Perceived Issue

### What Brunello Thought
- Clubhouse offers golf lessons/coaching
- Direct competition with their winter teaching program
- Simulator hours = instruction

### Reality (Discovered by Jordan Ells)
- Clubhouse offers simulator TIME, not lessons
- No coaching or instruction services
- Completely different business model
- Brunello management misunderstood entirely

## Failed Solutions Offered by WAY

1. **"Most Honest Team" Award**
   - For worst-scoring team
   - Required ADDITIONAL payment beyond hole sponsorship
   - Tone-deaf given honesty questions about situation
   - Mike correctly identified this as insulting

2. **Golf Cart Vouchers**
   - Contradicted hole sponsorship restriction
   - If simulator promotion not allowed on hole, why on carts?
   - Exposed logical inconsistency

3. **Email Mention**
   - Minimal recognition for sponsorship money
   - Not equivalent to hole presence
   - Ignored Mike's 1st place prize proposal

## Financial Impact

### Costs
- Hole sponsorship fee (kept as donation)
- Team entry fee (kept)
- Branded tournament prizes (already ordered, unusable)
- 5 simulator passes for auction (donated anyway)
- Marketing materials prepared for hole

### Returns
- Zero direct ROI from sponsorship
- Tournament victory (priceless PR)
- Demonstrated class and competitiveness

## Relationship Outcomes

### WAY Charity
- **Status**: Bridge burned
- **Quote**: "Unless the location changes... we will no longer be able to be a part of future tournaments"
- **Reason**: Poor handling, insulting alternatives, ignoring reasonable solutions

### Brunello Golf Course
- **Status**: Exposed incompetence
- **Issue**: Management doesn't understand competitor services
- **Note**: "History of poor decisions"

### River Oaks Golf Club
- **Status**: Strengthened partnership
- **Evidence**: GM played on winning team
- **Benefit**: Demonstrated alliance

## Strategic Victory

Despite being banned from hole sponsorship:
1. Assembled elite team including:
   - River Oaks GM (competitor course)
   - Trackman rep (Brunello supplier)
   - Top amateur players
2. Won tournament wearing Clubhouse branded hats
3. Accepted prize publicly with full Clubhouse branding
4. Got recognition without paying for upgraded sponsorship
5. Maintained moral high ground throughout

## Lessons Learned

### Contractual
1. Get written sponsorship terms with no-cancellation clauses
2. Define services explicitly (sim time â‰  lessons)
3. Require 60+ day notice for any changes
4. Document all charity sponsorship agreements

### Strategic
1. Tournament victory > paid sponsorship visibility
2. Maintaining professionalism preserves reputation
3. Strategic partnerships (River Oaks) matter more than venues
4. Don't take money back from charities

### Operational
1. Brunello management has pattern of poor decisions
2. WAY board quality declined post-Alanna
3. Clarify business model with all partners upfront
4. Keep donation even when treated poorly

## Email Evidence Highlights

### Brunello's Failures
- "They decided to bring this to our attention less than a month before" - Marie admission
- Claimed discussion with GM last year but never communicated to Clubhouse
- Misunderstood business entirely (thought sim hours = lessons)

### WAY's Missteps
- Offered insulting "Most Honest Team" award for MORE money
- Contradictory logic on cart vs. hole visibility
- Ignored reasonable 1st place prize proposal
- Attempted to retain sponsorship money initially

### Clubhouse's Professionalism
- "Consider it a separate donation" - refused refund
- Still provided auction items as promised
- Maintained team participation
- Clear about ending future involvement

## Post-Incident Analysis

### What Worked
- Keeping donation maintained moral high ground
- Strategic team selection created better outcome than sponsorship
- Jordan Ells' relationship revealed true issue
- Winning tournament in branded gear maximized visibility

### What Failed
- WAY's attempt at alternative solutions
- Brunello's understanding of business models
- Communication chains (year-old discussion never shared)
- Relationship preservation efforts

### Future Implications
1. No future WAY tournament participation at Brunello
2. Strengthened River Oaks partnership
3. Clear documentation for similar situations
4. Validated non-instruction business model

## Conclusion

The incident exemplifies how poor venue management and charity board decisions can damage long-standing partnerships. Despite losing hole sponsorship with < 1 month notice and receiving insulting alternative offers, Clubhouse maintained professionalism, supported the charity, and achieved superior visibility through strategic execution - winning the tournament while wearing branded merchandise.

The revelation that Brunello fundamentally misunderstood Clubhouse's business model (simulator time vs. lessons) adds incompetence to their poor timing. WAY's tone-deaf "Most Honest Team" offer for additional payment showed disconnection from the situation's irony.

Ultimately, Clubhouse's response - maintaining the donation, fielding an elite team, and winning the tournament - demonstrated that execution and class triumph over paid positioning and poor partnership management.
