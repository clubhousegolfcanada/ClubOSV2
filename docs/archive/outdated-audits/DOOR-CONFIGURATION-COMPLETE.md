# Door Configuration - Complete Status

## ‚úÖ Configuration Complete!

### What's Been Updated:

1. **Door Service (`unifiCloudService.ts`)**
   - Now only shows doors that actually exist
   - Configured with your actual MAC addresses
   - Ready for all locations as you add them

2. **Current Door Configuration:**

   **Bedford:**
   - ‚úÖ Front Door: `28:70:4e:80:c4:4f` (configured)
   - ‚úÖ Middle Door: `28:70:4e:80:de:f3` (configured)

   **Dartmouth:**
   - üîÑ Front Door: Placeholder (ready when you add MAC)
   - ‚úÖ Staff Door: `28:70:4e:80:de:3b` (configured)

   **Other Locations (Stratford, Bayers Lake, Truro):**
   - üîÑ Front Doors: Placeholders (ready when you switch to Ubiquiti)

3. **UI Components Updated:**
   - **Remote Actions Bar**: Dynamically shows doors from API
   - **Commands Page**: Shows correct doors per location

## üìä How It Works Now:

### Remote Actions Bar
- Automatically displays whatever doors the API returns
- Shows real-time status (locked/unlocked)
- Only shows configured doors

### Commands Page  
- **All locations**: Show "Front Door" button
- **Bedford only**: Shows "Front Door" + "Middle Door"
- **Dartmouth only**: Shows "Front Door" + "Staff Door"
- Other locations just show "Front Door" (placeholder for future)

## üß™ Testing Status:

```bash
‚úÖ Service configured with 3 actual door MACs
‚úÖ Running in DEMO mode (safe for testing)
‚úÖ Ready for real control once you add credentials
```

## üìù Your .env Configuration:

```env
# Currently in your .env
DARTMOUTH_STAFF_DOOR_MAC=28:70:4e:80:de:3b
BEDFORD_MIDDLE_DOOR_MAC=28:70:4e:80:de:f3
BEDFORD_MAIN_DOOR_MAC=28:70:4e:80:c4:4f
UNIFI_USE_NETWORK_API=true
```

## üöÄ Next Steps:

1. **Add More Doors** as you find them:
   ```env
   DARTMOUTH_MAIN_DOOR_MAC=<when-you-find-it>
   ```

2. **Enable Real Control** (when ready):
   - Add Mobile API token from app
   - Or set up Tailscale for direct connection

3. **Test in Production**:
   - System currently in safe DEMO mode
   - Shows [DEMO] prefix on all actions
   - Ready for real control when credentials added

## üéØ What Staff Will See:

### In Remote Actions Bar:
- Doors appear automatically based on what's configured
- Real-time status updates
- Clean, simple unlock buttons

### In Commands Page:
- Location-specific door buttons
- Bedford: Front + Middle doors
- Dartmouth: Front + Staff doors
- Others: Just Front door (ready for future)

## ‚úÖ Summary:

The door system is now correctly configured to:
1. Show front doors on all locations
2. Only show secondary doors we actually have (Bedford Middle, Dartmouth Staff)
3. Dynamically adapt as you add more doors
4. Work in demo mode until credentials are added

The system will automatically recognize and control new doors as you:
- Add their MAC addresses to .env
- Switch more locations to Ubiquiti
- Configure authentication (Mobile API or Tailscale)

**Status**: Ready for production use in demo mode!
