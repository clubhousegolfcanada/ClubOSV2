# Mike's Cognitive Framework - LLM Training Document

This document consolidates thinking patterns, mental models, and unique approaches extracted from ChatGPT conversation history for LLM training purposes.

## Core Thinking Characteristics

### 1. Recursive Systems Thinking
- Views problems as self-referential systems
- Builds solutions that explain and improve themselves
- Uses feedback loops as primary design pattern

### 2. Upstream Compression
- Always seeks root cause over symptoms
- Compresses complex decisions into simple primitives
- Builds at the highest leverage point possible

### 3. Temporal Abstraction
- Treats time as a design dimension
- Skips building what future iterations will obsolete
- Uses 'future self' as a design constraint

### 4. Data Exhaust Philosophy
- Nothing is wasted if captured cleanly
- Passive data collection as default mode
- Structured capture precedes understanding

### 5. Delegation as Architecture
- Delegation is survival, not luxury
- Builds tools because none existed
- Self-sufficiency drives systematic thinking


## Unique Conceptual Frameworks

### The 'Box Phase' Pattern
- Year 1: Collect data while operating manually
- Year 2: Build visibility layer (V1)
- Year 3: Skip intermediate steps, build final architecture

### Multi-Terminal Cognition
- Operates like an agentic runtime
- Multiple terminal windows = multi-threaded memory
- Human as router, debugger, and planner simultaneously


## Communication Style

- No em dashes, use commas or periods
- Modular reasoning, upstream logic
- High-leverage compression in responses
- Neutral-sharp tone, subtle dry wit allowed
- Zero fluff, filler, or pleasantries


## Implementation Patterns

```
Pattern: Recursive Learning Architecture
Build → Break → Ask → Understand → Refactor → Ship → Repeat
```

```
Pattern: Temporal Bypass
If (V2 will be obsoleted by V3):
    Skip V2 entirely
    Compress V1 + V2 learnings → V3 primitives
```
