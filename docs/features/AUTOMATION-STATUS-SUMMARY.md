# Gift Card Automation Status Summary

## Current State: Container Starting

The build completed successfully. The container is now starting and running migrations.

## What's Working âœ…
1. **Message Reception**: OpenPhone webhook receives messages
2. **Pattern Detection**: "gift cards" patterns are correctly identified
3. **LLM Analysis**: Enabled for all messages (not just initial ones)
4. **Assistant Response**: Successfully generates correct gift card response
   - Response: "Yes, we do sell gift cards. You can purchase them at clubhouse247golf.com/gift-card/purchase"

## What's Being Fixed ðŸ”§
1. **Database Migrations Running**:
   - Creating `ai_automation_response_tracking` table (migration 048)
   - Adding `assistant_type` columns to `openphone_conversations` (migration 049)
   - Fixed column rename conflicts
   - Fixed duplicate index creation

## Expected Outcome
Once migrations complete and container starts:
1. Send "do we sell gift cards?" to OpenPhone
2. System will:
   - Detect gift card inquiry âœ“
   - Get assistant response âœ“
   - Track response count (new table)
   - Update conversation type (new columns)
   - Send automated SMS response

## Monitoring
Watch for these logs:
- "âœ… All migrations completed successfully"
- "Lazy-initializing AssistantService"
- "Sending automated response"
- No more "relation does not exist" errors

## Timeline
- Build: âœ… Complete (27.55 seconds)
- Container: Starting...
- Migrations: Running...
- Ready: Pending...

The automation chain is fully functional - just waiting for database schema to support it!
