# Test Coverage Update Report

**Date:** August 2025  
**Status:** Improved but still needs work to reach 80% target

## Summary

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed Backend Test Issues**
   - Updated LLMService test expectations to match current API route names
   - Fixed async test issues with `isConfigured()` method
   - Route names updated: 'booking' → 'Booking & Access', 'emergency' → 'Emergency', etc.

2. **Added Frontend Component Tests**
   - ✅ RoleTag component (100% coverage)
   - ✅ Toggle component (100% coverage)
   - ✅ PasswordStrengthIndicator component (minor test issues)
   - Total new test files: 3 components

3. **Added Backend Route Tests**
   - ✅ AI Automations routes test suite
   - Covers all major endpoints
   - Tests authentication, authorization, and functionality

### Current Coverage Status

**Backend:**
- Overall: ~4% (low due to many untested files)
- Security tests: Comprehensive
- New AI automation tests: Good coverage
- Main issues: Missing imports, changed APIs

**Frontend:**
- Overall: Started at 0.32%, improved slightly
- Tested components: Button, Input, Toggle, RoleTag, PasswordStrengthIndicator
- Store tests: Still failing due to router issues
- Need many more component and page tests

## Test Infrastructure Status

### Working Well
- Jest configuration for both frontend and backend
- TypeScript support configured
- Test utilities and mocks set up
- Security test suite comprehensive

### Still Needs Work
1. **Backend:**
   - Fix missing module imports (slackSignature → slackSecurity)
   - Update integration tests for current API
   - Mock LLMRouter properly in tests

2. **Frontend:**
   - Fix store test router issues
   - Add tests for pages
   - Add tests for hooks
   - Test Navigation and other complex components

## Path to 80% Coverage

### Priority 1: Fix All Failing Tests
- Update import paths in backend tests
- Fix router mocking in frontend store tests
- Update API expectations in integration tests

### Priority 2: Test Critical Paths
**Backend:**
- Authentication flow
- OpenPhone webhook handler
- AI automation service
- Ticket system
- Message handling

**Frontend:**
- Login/logout flow
- Message interface
- Dashboard components
- Operations page
- ClubOS Boy interface

### Priority 3: Fill Coverage Gaps
- Test all API routes
- Test all React components
- Test all utility functions
- Test error handling paths

## Estimated Effort to 80%

- **Backend:** 2-3 days of focused testing
- **Frontend:** 3-4 days of comprehensive testing
- **Integration:** 1-2 days for E2E tests

Total: ~1 week of dedicated testing effort

## Recommendations

1. **Fix all failing tests first** - Can't build on broken foundation
2. **Focus on high-impact areas** - Authentication, messaging, AI features
3. **Use coverage reports** - Target uncovered files systematically
4. **Add tests with new features** - Prevent coverage regression
5. **Set up CI/CD** - Enforce minimum coverage on PR
