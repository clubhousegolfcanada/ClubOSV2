1. **GitHub receives the push**
2. **Vercel auto-deploys frontend** (1-2 minutes)
3. **Railway auto-deploys backend** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Demo mode is active** - all features work with simulated responses
5. **Production ready** - just add NinjaOne credentials when available

## Verification

After deployment completes:
1. Visit the production site
2. Login as operator
3. Go to Commands â†’ Remote Actions
4. Test a demo action
5. Check for [DEMO] prefix in responses

The NinjaOne integration is fully implemented and ready! ðŸš€
