# V3-PLS & Integrations Page Audit - September 2025

## Executive Summary
Audit of the Operations Center's Integrations & AI page reveals significant duplication and placeholder elements that should be cleaned up. Most functionality has been moved to the V3-PLS page or is non-functional.

## Findings

### 1. Integrations & AI Page (operations.tsx â†’ OperationsIntegrations.tsx)

#### Functional Elements
- **Communication Section**: 
  - Slack configuration (working)
  - OpenPhone configuration (working)
  - Push Notifications configuration (working)

- **CRM & Support Section**:
  - HubSpot, NinjaOne, UniFi Access cards exist but only show status
  - "Configure" buttons just show toast messages with env variable instructions
  - No actual configuration UI

- **System Features Section**:
  - 4 toggles (Smart Assist, Bookings, Tickets, Customer Kiosk)
  - Appear to be placeholders - no evidence of actual functionality

- **API Key Management Section**:
  - Purely informational display
  - Shows "Configured" status but no actual management capability

#### Duplicated/Redundant Elements
- **AI Automations Section** (lines 931-968):
  - Shows same AI features as V3-PLS page
  - Uses same AIFeatureCard component
  - Fetches from same `/api/ai-automations` endpoint
  - **DUPLICATE - Already in V3-PLS page**

- **Knowledge Management Section** (lines 971-993):
  - Shows KnowledgeRouterPanel component
  - Collapsible section that's hidden by default
  - **UNCLEAR PURPOSE - No clear integration with V3-PLS**

### 2. V3-PLS Page (OperationsPatternsEnhanced.tsx)

#### Current Functionality
- Live Pattern Dashboard (real-time queue)
- Pattern management with enable/disable
- AI Automations tab with AIFeatureCard components
- Pattern statistics and execution history
- Import/Export functionality

#### AI Automations in V3-PLS
- Located in "AI Automations" tab (lines 851-889)
- Uses same AIFeatureCard component
- Fetches from same endpoint as Integrations page
- **This is the primary location for AI Automations**

### 3. Knowledge Management Status
- KnowledgeRouterPanel component exists in 3 places:
  1. OperationsIntegrations.tsx (collapsible section)
  2. OperationsAICenter.tsx (unused component)
  3. admin/KnowledgeRouterPanel.tsx (actual component)
- No evidence of integration with main dashboard or V3-PLS Import tab

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Remove from Integrations Page**:
   - AI Automations section (duplicate of V3-PLS)
   - Knowledge Management section (if not actively used)
   - System Features section (if placeholders)
   - API Key Management section (if display-only)

2. **Keep in Integrations Page**:
   - Communication section (Slack, OpenPhone, Push)
   - CRM & Support section (but mark as "Coming Soon" or remove fake functionality)

3. **Clean Up Unused Components**:
   - Check if OperationsAICenter.tsx is used anywhere
   - Remove if orphaned

### Code Changes Needed

#### 1. Remove AI Automations from Integrations
- Delete lines 931-968 in OperationsIntegrations.tsx
- Remove related state and functions (lines 134, 146, 159-164, 166-179, 287-296, 299-309)

#### 2. Remove/Relocate Knowledge Management
- Either remove lines 971-993 or move to dedicated page
- Consider if this belongs in V3-PLS Import tab

#### 3. Simplify System Features
- Either implement actual functionality or remove section
- Lines 833-868 should be evaluated

#### 4. Update CRM & Support Section
- Add "Coming Soon" badges or remove non-functional buttons
- Make it clear what's actually connected vs placeholder

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, less confusing interface
- **Code Maintenance**: Reduced duplication, clearer separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Fewer API calls, less component rendering

## Migration Path
1. Backup current code
2. Remove duplicated sections
3. Update navigation if needed
4. Test all remaining functionality
5. Deploy and monitor

## Conclusion
The Integrations page has become a catch-all with significant duplication. The V3-PLS page is the proper home for AI Automations and pattern learning. The Integrations page should focus solely on third-party service configurations (Slack, OpenPhone, Push, and future CRM integrations).
