## Priority Guidelines
- **Low**: User inconvenience, workarounds available
- **Medium**: Feature not working, affects gameplay
- **High**: Complete system failure, multiple bays affected
- **Urgent**: Safety risk or facility-wide outage (escalate to Emergency)

## Always Include
1. Estimated resolution time
2. Technical level required
3. Clear step-by-step actions
4. Escalation path if solution doesn't work

Remember: Provide clear, actionable steps that users of any technical level can follow. Always offer escalation options for complex issues.
