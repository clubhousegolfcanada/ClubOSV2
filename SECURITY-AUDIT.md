# CRITICAL SECURITY AUDIT - Customer Role Access

## Issues Found:

### 1. Frontend Pages (CRITICAL)
- ❌ `/messages.tsx` - NO role check (customers can see all messages!)
- ❌ `/messages-redesigned.tsx` - NO role check
- ❌ `/tickets.tsx` - NO role check  
- ❌ `/checklists.tsx` - NO role check
- ✅ `/operations.tsx` - Has role check but redirects to `/` (fixed)
- ✅ `/index.tsx` - NOW PROTECTED (just fixed)

### 2. Backend Routes
- ✅ Messages API - Protected with roleGuard
- ⚠️ Tickets API - Some endpoints unprotected
- ✅ Checklists API - Protected appropriately

### 3. Navigation Issues
- ❌ Customer accounts can switch to operator mode
- ❌ ModeToggle component accessible to customers

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added role check to index.tsx to redirect customers
2. ✅ Added 'customer' to auth middleware valid roles

## Fixes Still Needed:
1. Add role checks to ALL operator frontend pages
2. Remove mode toggle for customer accounts
3. Add roleGuard to tickets API endpoints
4. Ensure complete isolation between customer and operator views

## Security Principle:
**CUSTOMERS SHOULD NEVER SEE:**
- Operator dashboard
- Messages from other customers
- Tickets/issues
- Checklists (operator)
- User management
- Any operational data
