# Test Coverage Report and Improvement Plan

## Current Status

### Backend Coverage: 9.14%
- Statements: 9.14%
- Branches: 1.14%
- Functions: 6.04%
- Lines: 9.45%

### Frontend Coverage: In Progress
- Some component tests exist but coverage reporting has issues
- Tests passing for: Button, Input, Toggle, RoleTag, PasswordStrengthIndicator

## Completed Work

1. ✅ Fixed failing backend tests
2. ✅ Fixed AI automation pattern matching tests
3. ✅ Added tests for AI automation patterns (100% coverage for that module)
4. ✅ Fixed roleAuth import error
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in messaging module
6. ✅ Created documentation for adding new AI automations

## Areas Needing Test Coverage

### Backend Priority Areas (0% coverage):
1. **Routes** - Most route files have 0% coverage
   - `/routes/admin.ts`
   - `/routes/auth.ts`
   - `/routes/users.ts`
   - `/routes/customers.ts`
   - `/routes/knowledge-base.ts`
   - `/routes/sops.ts`
   - `/routes/settings.ts`

2. **Services** - Critical services with 0% coverage
   - `assistantService.ts`
   - `authService.ts`
   - `customerService.ts`
   - `notificationService.ts`
   - `openPhoneService.ts`
   - `knowledgeService.ts`

3. **Utilities** - Core utilities with 0% coverage
   - `database.ts` (only 4.72%)
   - `encryption.ts`
   - `logger.ts`
   - `cache.ts`

### Frontend Priority Areas:
1. **Components** - Need tests for:
   - Dashboard components
   - Settings components
   - Messaging components
   - AI automation UI components

2. **State Management**
   - useStore hooks
   - API integration tests

3. **Pages**
   - Login/Auth flows
   - Dashboard pages
   - Settings pages

## Recommended Approach to Reach 80% Coverage

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Backend)
1. Add tests for database utilities and helpers
2. Test authentication middleware and services
3. Test core utility functions (encryption, logging, cache)

### Phase 2: API Routes (Backend)
1. Test auth routes (login, logout, session)
2. Test CRUD operations for main entities
3. Test error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Services (Backend)
1. Mock external dependencies (OpenPhone, HubSpot, etc.)
2. Test service methods with various scenarios
3. Test error cases and edge conditions

### Phase 4: Frontend Components
1. Test all UI components with React Testing Library
2. Test state management and hooks
3. Test page-level integration

### Phase 5: Integration Tests
1. End-to-end API tests
2. Frontend integration with backend
3. WebSocket/real-time features

## Quick Wins for Coverage

1. **Utility Functions** - Easy to test, high impact
2. **Database Helpers** - Pure functions, straightforward testing
3. **Validation Functions** - Input/output testing
4. **Simple Components** - Buttons, inputs, displays

## Testing Tools and Setup

- Backend: Jest with TypeScript
- Frontend: Jest with React Testing Library
- Mocking: Jest mocks for external services
- Coverage: Jest coverage reports

## Next Steps

1. Start with utility function tests (quick wins)
2. Add route tests with supertest
3. Mock external services for service tests
4. Expand frontend component tests
5. Add integration tests

The goal of 80% coverage is achievable but will require systematic addition of tests across all modules.
