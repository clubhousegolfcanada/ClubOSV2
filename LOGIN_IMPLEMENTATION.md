# Login/Logout Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed
The logout button was working but there was no login page to return to. I've implemented a complete authentication flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Login Page (`/login`)
- Clean, modern login interface
- Role selection for demo mode (Admin/Operator/Support)
- Auto-fills demo credentials
- Shows role descriptions

### 2. Updated Authentication State
- Added `login()` function to auth store
- Modified `logout()` to redirect to `/login`
- Stores user data in localStorage for persistence
- Clears all sensitive data on logout

### 3. Added Route Protection
- Created `AuthGuard` component
- Protected all routes except login
- Auto-redirects to login if not authenticated
- Restores session on page refresh

### 4. Updated Navigation
- Only shows on authenticated pages
- Hides on login page
- Logout button properly redirects

## How to Test

1. **Logout Flow**:
   - Click the logout button
   - You'll be redirected to `/login`
   - All user data is cleared

2. **Login Flow**:
   - Enter any email/password (demo mode)
   - Select a role (Admin/Operator/Support)
   - Click "Sign in"
   - You'll be logged in with the selected role

3. **Role Testing**:
   - Login as different roles
   - See how UI adapts based on role
   - Test restricted features

4. **Session Persistence**:
   - Login with any role
   - Refresh the page
   - You'll remain logged in

## Demo Credentials
- **Email**: Any email (e.g., demo@clubos.com)
- **Password**: Any value (not validated in demo)
- **Roles**: Select from dropdown

The authentication system is now complete with proper login/logout flow and role-based access control!
