## Testing

1. **Create a new user with phone number**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "Test123!",
       "name": "Test User",
       "phone": "+1 (902) 555-0123",
       "role": "operator"
     }'
   ```

2. **Update user profile**:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/auth/users/USER_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "phone": "+1 (902) 555-0124"
     }'
   ```

3. **Test admin editing**:

   - Go to Operations â†’ Settings â†’ User Management
   - Click the edit icon next to any user
   - Modify their information and save

   - Go to Operations â†’ Profile
   - Update your personal information
   - Change your password

5. **Test Slack notifications** to see enhanced user information:
   - Create a ticket
   - Send a direct message to Slack
   - Trigger an LLM fallback

## Benefits
