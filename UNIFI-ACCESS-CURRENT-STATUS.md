# UniFi Access Current Status & Solutions

## üîç What We Found

### Your Setup
- **Console Type**: UniFi Network Console (not dedicated Access console)
- **Console ID**: `0CEA1424DB29000000000861C4610000000008D3E6AB000000006703125C:145557302`
- **Dashboard URL**: https://unifi.ui.com/consoles/[console-id]/network/default/dashboard

### The Challenge
1. You have a UniFi **Network** console, not a UniFi **Access** console
2. CloudFront is blocking automated authentication attempts (403 error)
3. The UniFi Access mobile app likely uses a different authentication method

## üöÄ Solutions Available

### Option 1: Check for UniFi Access in Your Network Console
UniFi Access devices might be managed through your Network console.

**Steps:**
1. Log into https://unifi.ui.com
2. Go to your Network console
3. Check Devices section for:
   - UniFi Access Hub (UAH)
   - UniFi Access Lite (UA-Lite)
   - Any devices with "door" in the name
4. If found, note their MAC addresses

### Option 2: Use UniFi's Mobile API
The mobile app uses different endpoints that might bypass CloudFront.

**What we need:**
1. Install the UniFi Access mobile app
2. Log in and verify you can see/control doors
3. If yes, we can implement mobile API endpoints

### Option 3: Direct Local Connection (Most Reliable)
Connect directly to controllers at each location.

**Requirements:**
- VPN access to location networks, OR
- Port forwarding on routers, OR
- Tailscale mesh VPN (recommended)

### Option 4: UniFi Identity Enterprise
UniFi is transitioning to Identity Enterprise for access control.

**Check if available:**
1. Go to https://unifi.ui.com
2. Look for "Identity" or "Identity Enterprise" application
3. This might be where door access is now managed

## üì± Mobile App vs Web API

The UniFi Access mobile app works because:
1. Uses native mobile authentication (OAuth)
2. Different API endpoints optimized for mobile
3. Bypasses CloudFront restrictions
4. May use app-specific tokens

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Workarounds

### 1. Tailscale Setup (Recommended)
**Time to implement**: 30 minutes

```bash
# Install on each controller location
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up

# Note the Tailscale IPs (100.x.x.x)
# Update .env with direct controller URLs
UNIFI_CONTROLLER_URL=https://100.x.x.x:12445
```

### 2. Manual Door Control
While we solve the API issue:
1. Use UniFi Access mobile app for door control
2. Log actions manually in ClubOS
3. Staff can use mobile app when needed

### 3. Webhook Integration
Set up UniFi to send webhooks to ClubOS:
1. In UniFi settings, configure webhooks
2. Point to ClubOS endpoint
3. ClubOS logs door events automatically

## üîÑ Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Check if you have UniFi Access devices in Network console
2. ‚úÖ Test if mobile app can control doors
3. ‚úÖ Determine if using Identity Enterprise

### Phase 2: Implementation (This Week)
Based on Phase 1 findings:

**If Access devices in Network console:**
- Use Network API to control them
- MAC addresses as device identifiers

**If using Identity Enterprise:**
- Switch to Identity API endpoints
- Update authentication flow

**If mobile app works:**
- Reverse engineer mobile API
- Implement mobile endpoints

**If none of above:**
- Set up Tailscale for direct access
- No cloud dependency

## üìù Questions to Answer

1. **Do you see any Access devices in your UniFi Network console?**
   - Check under Devices section
   - Look for UAH, UA-Lite, or door controllers

2. **Can you control doors from the UniFi Access mobile app?**
   - If yes, we can use mobile API approach

3. **Is Identity Enterprise available in your UniFi account?**
   - Check at https://unifi.ui.com

4. **Do you have physical/VPN access to locations?**
   - For direct controller connection option

## üéØ Recommended Path Forward

### Best Option: Tailscale + Direct Connection
**Why:**
- Works reliably without cloud issues
- 30-minute setup
- Free for your use case
- Very secure
- No CloudFront blocking

**Steps:**
1. Install Tailscale at each location
2. Get Tailscale IPs for controllers
3. Update ClubOS to use direct connections
4. Test and deploy

### Alternative: Wait for Official API Update
UniFi is actively developing their API. The CloudFront issue suggests they're updating their infrastructure.

## üìû Next Actions

1. **Check your UniFi console** for Access devices
2. **Test the mobile app** to confirm it works
3. **Let me know** what you find
4. **Choose** an implementation path

The system is ready to work with any of these approaches. We just need to determine which one fits your setup best.
