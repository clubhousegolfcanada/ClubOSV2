### ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist

#### 1. Environment Variables (Railway)
```env
# SOP System - REQUIRED
USE_INTELLIGENT_SOP=false          # Start with false
SOP_SHADOW_MODE=true              # Enable shadow mode first
SOP_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75     # Minimum confidence required

# OpenPhone - REQUIRED (get from OpenPhone dashboard)
OPENPHONE_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

#### 2. OpenPhone Configuration
- [ ] Get API key from OpenPhone Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API
- [ ] Configure webhook URL: `https://your-backend.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook`
- [ ] Select these events:
  - [ ] message.received
  - [ ] message.delivered
  - [ ] call.completed
  - [ ] call.summary.completed
  - [ ] call.transcript.completed
- [ ] Set webhook secret (must match Railway env var)

#### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# SSH into Railway or check logs for:
- "SOP module status: { initialized: true, documentCount: X }"
- "SOP embeddings initialized successfully"
- "OpenPhone webhook received" (when testing webhook)
```

#### 4. Testing Shadow Mode
1. Make normal requests through ClubOS
2. Check Railway logs for "SHADOW MODE - SOP Response"
3. Verify shadow comparisons in database
4. Monitor confidence scores

#### 5. Migration Path
```
Week 1: Shadow Mode
- Monitor logs and comparisons
- Adjust confidence threshold if needed

Week 2: Partial Rollout
- Set USE_INTELLIGENT_SOP=true
- Keep SOP_SHADOW_MODE=false
- Monitor performance

Week 3: Full Production
- Confirm $750/month savings
- Document any edge cases
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] All SOP files loaded (check logs)
- [ ] Embeddings generated for all documents
- [ ] Shadow mode logging comparisons
- [ ] OpenPhone webhooks received
- [ ] Response times < 1 second
- [ ] Confidence scores > 0.75 for most queries

### ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan
If any issues occur:
```env
# Instant rollback - just change these:
USE_INTELLIGENT_SOP=false
SOP_SHADOW_MODE=false
```

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check system status
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/sop-monitoring/status

# View shadow comparisons
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/sop-monitoring/shadow-stats

# Test OpenPhone webhook
curl -X POST https://your-backend.railway.app/api/openphone/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"message.received","data":{"phoneNumber":"test"}}'
```

## Summary
The SOP migration system is fully deployed and ready for production use. Start with shadow mode to safely test alongside existing OpenAI Assistants, then gradually migrate based on confidence metrics.
