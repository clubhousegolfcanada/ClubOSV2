# ClubOS Branding Update

## Summary
Successfully updated all visible references from "ClubOSV1" to "ClubOS" throughout the application.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates
- ✅ Navigation bar logo: "ClubOSV1" → "ClubOS"
- ✅ Login page header: "ClubOS Lite" → "ClubOS"
- ✅ Dashboard header: "ClubOS Lite" → "ClubOS"
- ✅ Page title: "ClubOSV1 - Golf Simulator Management" → "ClubOS - Golf Simulator Management"
- ✅ Package name: "clubosv1-frontend" → "clubos-frontend"
- ✅ Zustand store name: "ClubOSV1 Store" → "ClubOS Store"

### Backend Updates
- ✅ Package name: "clubosv1-backend" → "clubos-backend"
- ✅ Package description: Updated to "ClubOS Backend"
- ✅ Environment file header: Updated to "ClubOS Backend"
- ✅ Slack bot name: "ClubOSV1 Bot" → "ClubOS Bot"

## Important Notes

### What Was NOT Changed
- **Folder names**: Still `ClubOSV1-backend` and `ClubOSV1-frontend`
  - Changing these would require updating all import paths
  - Not necessary for branding purposes
- **File names**: No file names contained "ClubOSV1"
- **Code identifiers**: No variable or function names needed updating

### Why This Works
- The changes are purely cosmetic/branding related
- No functional code was modified
- All import paths remain the same
- No runtime errors will occur

## Result
The application now displays as "ClubOS" everywhere users can see it, while maintaining the same folder structure for development continuity.
