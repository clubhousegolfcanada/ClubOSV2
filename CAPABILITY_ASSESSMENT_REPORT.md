- Thread-based conversation tracking by phone number
- Webhook integration for real-time message reception
- Call transcript analysis capabilities
- Customer name and metadata storage

**Implementation Status:** 90% Complete
- Database schema: `openphone_conversations` table
- Service layer: `openphoneService.ts` with full API coverage
- Missing: Automated conversation categorization

### 2. AI-Powered Response System âœ… READY

**Current State:**
- GPT-4 router analyzes customer queries

2. Router selects appropriate assistant based on keywords/context
3. Assistant generates response using SOPs and knowledge base
4. Response sent back via OpenPhone SMS

### 3. Automated Booking Changes ðŸ”„ PARTIALLY READY

**Current State:**
- Basic booking API exists (`/api/bookings`)
- Can create, cancel, and check availability
- No direct AI integration yet

**Required Implementation:**
1. Create GPT function for booking modifications
2. Add booking context to AI assistants
3. Implement validation and conflict checking
4. Add customer confirmation workflow

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 4. NinjaOne Trackman Reset Automation âœ… READY

**Current State:**
- Full NinjaOne integration implemented
- Remote script execution capabilities
- Device status monitoring
- PowerShell scripts ready:
  - `Restart-TrackMan.ps1`
  - `Reboot-SimulatorPC.ps1`
  - `Restart-TVSystem.ps1`
  - `Restart-MusicSystem.ps1`

**Implementation Path:**
1. Add "reset trackman" intent to Tech Support Assistant
2. Create safety checks (confirm bay is empty)
3. Execute NinjaOne script via API
4. Confirm completion to customer

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

### 5. Gift Card Inquiry Handling âœ… READY

**Current State:**
- Brand Assistant handles marketing queries
- Can be configured with gift card SOPs

**Simple Implementation:**
```javascript
// Add to Brand Assistant instructions
"When customers ask about gift cards, guide them to:
www.clubhouse247golf.com/giftcard/purchase

Explain available denominations and that cards can be used
for bay time, food, and beverages."
```

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance AI Response Patterns (1 week)
1. **Analyze Historical Conversations**
   - Use existing `knowledgeExtractor` service
   - Extract common customer queries and responses
   - Update assistant SOPs with real patterns

2. **Implement Response Validation**
   - Add safety filters for AI responses
   - Require confirmation for actions (bookings, resets)
   - Log all AI decisions for audit

### Phase 2: Booking Automation (1 week)
1. **Create Booking Functions**
   ```typescript
   // Add to assistant capabilities
   - checkAvailability(date, duration, bay?)
   - modifyBooking(bookingId, newTime)
   - cancelBooking(bookingId, reason)
   ```

2. **Implement Confirmation Flow**
   - AI suggests booking change
   - Send confirmation SMS
   - Customer replies YES to confirm
   - Execute booking modification

### Phase 3: Trackman Reset Automation (3 days)
1. **Pattern Recognition**
   ```
   Customer: "Trackman frozen on bay 3"
   AI: "I can reset the Trackman on bay 3. This will take about 2 minutes. 
        Please ensure no one is actively using the bay. Reply YES to proceed."
   ```

2. **Execution Flow**
   - Verify bay status (if possible)
   - Execute NinjaOne reset script
   - Monitor completion
   - Notify customer

### Phase 4: Knowledge Learning System (Ongoing)
1. **Automated SOP Updates**
   - Weekly analysis of resolved conversations
   - Extract new solutions and patterns
   - Admin reviews and approves updates
   - SOPs automatically updated

## Success Metrics

1. **Response Automation Rate**
   - Target: 70% of inquiries handled without human intervention
   - Current estimate: 40-50% achievable immediately

2. **Trackman Reset Success**
   - Target: 90% of Trackman issues resolved automatically
   - Reduces 50% of current support tickets

3. **Booking Modification Rate**
   - Target: 80% of booking changes handled by AI
   - Frees up staff for complex issues

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Safety Checks**
   - All automated actions require customer confirmation
   - Equipment resets check bay occupancy
   - Booking changes validate business rules

2. **Fallback to Human**
   - Low confidence scores trigger Slack notification
   - Complex requests escalated to staff
   - Emergency situations always alert humans

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All AI decisions logged
   - Customer confirmations stored
   - Action results tracked

## Technical Requirements

### Already Available:
- âœ… OpenPhone API integration
- âœ… GPT-4 with specialized assistants
