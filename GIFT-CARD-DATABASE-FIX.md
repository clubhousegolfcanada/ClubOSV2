# Gift Card Automation Database Fix - Complete Investigation

## Errors Found (2025-08-06)

### 1. Missing Table: ai_automation_response_tracking
**Error**: `relation "ai_automation_response_tracking" does not exist`
- Migration 048 created this table but it didn't run in production
- Table tracks response counts to prevent spam

### 2. Missing Columns: assistant_type
**Error**: `column "assistant_type" does not exist`  
- Migration 049 added these columns but didn't run
- Columns track which assistant handled each conversation

### 3. Incorrect Query: phone_number column
**Error**: Query included `phone_number` column that doesn't exist
- Code tried to insert phone_number into ai_automation_response_tracking
- Table schema doesn't include this column

## Root Cause
Migration 010 (learning_sop_module.sql) was failing and blocking all subsequent migrations:
- It tried to create indexes before tables existed
- The migration runner couldn't handle the complex SQL properly
- Migrations 048, 049, 050 never ran

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed incrementResponseCount query
- Removed phone_number column from INSERT statement
- Now matches actual table schema

### 2. Fixed migration 010
- Wrapped everything in DO blocks
- Added proper existence checks
- Tables created before indexes

### 3. Created force migration 051
- Ensures ai_automation_response_tracking table exists
- Adds assistant_type columns to openphone_conversations  
- Uses DO blocks to handle partial failures
- Will succeed even if previous migrations failed

## Current Status
- All fixes committed and deployed
- Migration 051 will create missing schema
- Gift card automation should work once deployed

## Testing
After deployment completes:
1. Check Railway logs for "Migration 051" success
2. Send "do you sell gift cards?" to customer line
3. Should get automated response from Booking & Access assistant
