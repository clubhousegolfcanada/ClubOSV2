# UniFi API Key Configuration Status

## ‚úÖ Current Status
- **API Key Configured**: `5GmQjC0y7sgfJ0JmPmh17dL17SOFp8IV`
- **System Status**: Connected to UniFi (not in demo mode)
- **Console ID**: `0CEA1424DB29000000000861C4610000000008D3E6AB000000006703125C:145557302`

## üîß What's Working
1. API key authentication is active
2. System recognizes it's not in demo mode
3. Ready for real door control

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Adjustment
The API endpoints need to be updated for the Ubiquiti API key format. The API key likely uses different endpoints than the standard UniFi Access API.

## üìù Configured Doors
- **Bedford Front Door**: `28:70:4e:80:c4:4f`
- **Bedford Middle Door**: `28:70:4e:80:de:f3`
- **Dartmouth Staff Door**: `28:70:4e:80:de:3b`

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. The API key is working - the system is no longer in demo mode
2. We need to determine the correct API endpoints for door control with this API key
3. The doors might need to be referenced by MAC address directly

## üß™ Testing
To test door control:
```bash
cd ClubOSV1-backend
npx tsx scripts/test-unlock-door.ts
```

This will allow you to:
- Select which door to unlock
- Specify unlock duration
- See real-time results

## ‚ùì Questions
1. Where did you get this API key from? (UniFi Access, UniFi Cloud, or UniFi Identity?)
2. Do you have documentation for the API endpoints that work with this key?
3. Can you access the UniFi web interface to verify the doors are online?

The system is connected and ready - we just need to ensure we're using the correct API endpoints for your specific UniFi setup.
