# Brunello/WAY Tournament Sponsorship Incident

## Timeline
- **8 years ago**: Alanna (Clubhouse) helped found WAY charity, served on board
- **Previous year**: Clubhouse sponsored hole, gave away free sim hours (successful)
- **Current year - Initial**: First companies to sign up, paid for hole + team entry
- **Aug 12, 2025**: Brunello claims "direct competition", removes hole sponsorship
- **Aug 18, 2025**: WAY offers insulting alternatives
- **Tournament day**: Clubhouse team wins tournament wearing Clubhouse hats

## Email Chain Summary

### Initial Conflict (Aug 12)
- Marie Boccabella notifies about Brunello's objection to simulator promotion
- Claims it was discussed with GM last year (never communicated to Clubhouse)
- Mike proposes solution: Convert hole sponsorship to 1st place prize enhancement

### WAY's Failed Solutions (Aug 18)
1. **"Most Honest Team" award** - Pay MORE to sponsor worst team (tone-deaf given honesty issues)
2. **Cart vouchers** - Contradicts hole restriction logic
3. **Email mention** - Minimal recognition offered

### Resolution Points
- Clubhouse refused refund (kept donation to charity)
- Team participation confirmed
- 5 simulator passes still donated for auction
- Team changes allowed up to tournament day

## Key Players
- **WAY**: Marie Boccabella (Wish Director), Katie
- **Clubhouse**: Mike, Nick, Dylan, Jason, Alanna (founder)
- **Winning Team**: Graeme Burke, Justin Burke, Jordan Ells, 4th player

## Business Impact Analysis

### Financial
- Lost: Hole sponsorship visibility
- Lost: Branded tournament prizes (already ordered)
- Kept: Team entry fee + hole sponsorship fee (as donation)
- Given: 5 simulator passes for auction

### Relationships
- **WAY**: Bridge burned ("will no longer be able to be a part of future tournaments")
- **Brunello**: Exposed incompetence (misunderstood business model)
- **River Oaks**: Strengthened (GM played on winning team)

### Marketing Victory
- Won tournament with branded hats
- Got visibility despite restrictions
- Demonstrated competitive excellence

## Documentation Evidence
- Email thread shows < 1 month notice
- Brunello's reasoning inconsistent (cart vouchers OK but hole isn't?)
- WAY admitted Brunello brought this "less than a month before"
- Player substitution rights confirmed

## Lessons Learned
1. Get written terms with no-cancellation clauses
2. Clarify service definitions (sim hours â‰  lessons)
3. Document charity agreements formally
4. Brunello management incompetent (Jordan Ells confirmed misunderstanding)
5. Strategic team composition > paid sponsorship

## Follow-up Actions
- [x] Keep donation (no refund to charity)
- [x] Provide auction items as promised
- [x] Win tournament with branded gear
- [x] Document incident for future reference
- [ ] Avoid Brunello-hosted events going forward
