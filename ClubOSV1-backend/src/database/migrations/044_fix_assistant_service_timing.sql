-- This migration doesn't change the database, but documents the fix needed
-- for the assistantService timing issue with Railway environment variables

-- The issue: assistantService is instantiated at module load time,
-- which happens BEFORE Railway's environment variables are available

-- The fix implemented in the code:
-- 1. Changed assistantService to lazy-load on first use
-- 2. Added logging to show when env vars are actually available
-- 3. This ensures OpenAI API key and Assistant IDs are loaded

-- To verify the fix works, check logs for:
-- "AssistantService: OpenAI API key configured, assistant features enabled"
-- This should appear when the first message is processed, not at startup

-- No database changes needed for this fix
