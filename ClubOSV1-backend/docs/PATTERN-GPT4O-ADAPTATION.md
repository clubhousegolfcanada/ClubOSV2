# How GPT-4o Adapts Pattern Responses

## Overview
When a pattern matches, GPT-4o takes the response template and adapts it to:
1. Match the customer's tone and style
2. Maintain Clubhouse brand voice
3. Keep factual information exactly the same
4. Make the response feel natural and contextual

## The Process

### 1. Pattern Matching
When a customer message comes in:
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to find similar questions
- **Keyword Matching**: Checks for trigger keywords
- **GPT-4o Validation**: Confirms the pattern is appropriate

### 2. Response Generation with GPT-4o
Once a pattern is selected, GPT-4o receives:

```javascript
// From patternLearningService.ts lines 1257-1278
const systemPrompt = `You are an AI customer service agent for a golf simulator facility.

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY use information from the pattern template
- NEVER make up facility policies, rules, hours, or services  
- Adapt the wording to be natural while keeping factual content exactly the same
- Maintain Clubhouse brand voice: friendly, casual, helpful

Pattern Response Template: "${pattern.response_template}"

Your job is to:
1. Analyze the customer's message tone and context
2. Use ONLY the pattern's template response
3. Adapt wording to be natural and conversational
4. Keep all facts, URLs, prices EXACTLY the same
5. Match how formal/casual the customer is being`;
```

### 3. Examples of Adaptation

#### Example 1: Formal Customer
**Customer asks**: "Good afternoon. Could you please provide information regarding your hourly rates?"
**Template**: "www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing is the best place. The website says it more elegantly than I do."
**GPT-4o adapts to**: "Good afternoon! You can find our complete pricing information at www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing. The website has all our current rates clearly laid out."

#### Example 2: Casual Customer  
**Customer asks**: "yo how much?"
**Template**: "www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing is the best place. The website says it more elegantly than I do."
**GPT-4o adapts to**: "Hey! Check out www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing for all the rates üëç"

#### Example 3: Frustrated Customer
**Customer asks**: "I've been trying to find out how much it costs for an hour. Why is this so hard?"
**Template**: "www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing is the best place. The website says it more elegantly than I do."
**GPT-4o adapts to**: "I understand the frustration! Let me help - all our hourly rates are at www.clubhouse247golf.com/pricing. You'll find everything clearly listed there."

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ What GPT-4o DOES Change:
- Greeting style (formal vs casual)
- Sentence structure for natural flow
- Acknowledgment of customer's emotional state
- Adding appropriate context transitions
- Matching energy level

### ‚ùå What GPT-4o NEVER Changes:
- URLs (always exact)
- Prices or rates
- Business hours
- Policies (food, alcohol, etc.)
- Services offered
- Contact information
- Any factual details

## Configuration

### Current Settings (patternLearningService.ts):
```javascript
temperature: 0.3  // Low temperature for consistency
model: 'gpt-4o'  // Advanced reasoning model
```

### Safety Mechanisms:
1. **Validation**: GPT-4o validates pattern matches before responding
2. **Template Boundaries**: System instructions prevent making up information
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Only high-confidence patterns auto-execute

## Testing Response Adaptation

You can test how GPT-4o will adapt a response using the test endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/patterns/test-match
{
  "message": "how much does it cost?",
  "pattern_id": 123
}
```

This will show:
- Whether the pattern would trigger
- How GPT-4o would adapt the response
- The reasoning behind the adaptation

## Clubhouse Brand Voice

The system maintains Clubhouse tone by:
- Being friendly but not overly formal
- Using casual language when appropriate
- Avoiding corporate jargon
- Being helpful and solution-oriented
- Acknowledging the 24/7 automated nature when relevant

## Summary

The pattern system gives you the best of both worlds:
1. **Control**: You define the exact information in templates
2. **Natural Responses**: GPT-4o makes it conversational
3. **Safety**: Information never gets made up or changed
4. **Brand Consistency**: Maintains Clubhouse voice across all interactions
