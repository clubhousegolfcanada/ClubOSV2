**Status**: COMPLETE

## What Was Done

### Files Reorganized

✅ Database Tables - All 103 tables intact
✅ Critical Tables - All have data (users, profiles, etc.)
✅ Migration Tracking - Version 200 tracked
✅ Foreign Keys - All 96 constraints present
✅ Indexes - All 358 indexes present
✅ Database Backup - Full backup available

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Structure**: 89 files → 1 file
2. **No Conflicts**: Single source of truth
3. **Faster Development**: Clear migration path
4. **Full Safety**: Complete backup and rollback available

## Next Steps

For future migrations:
1. Create new migration files starting from 201
2. They will build on top of the consolidated baseline
3. Example: `201_add_new_feature.sql`

## Rollback Information (If Ever Needed)

The system can be rolled back using:
```bash
cd ClubOSV1-backend
./scripts/rollback-procedures.sh
```

Archive location: `src/database/migrations/archived_2025_08_24/`
