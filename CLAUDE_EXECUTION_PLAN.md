# Claude's Realistic Execution Plan

## My Constraints
- **Context window**: ~200k tokens (need to save room for code reading)
- **Can't test**: I can only write code and hope it works
- **Memory**: I don't remember between conversations
- **Time**: Each response takes time, you're waiting

## Smart Approach: Tiny Incremental Changes

### What I CAN Do Effectively

#### Option 1: One Component at a Time (Recommended)
```
1. Create Card component (5 lines)
2. You test it on ONE page
3. If it works, I apply to 3-4 pages
4. Next session: Create Button component
5. Repeat
```

**Why this works:**
- Small changes = less chance of breaking
- You test between my changes
- Each session builds on last (via git history)
- I don't need to track complex state

#### Option 2: One Page Complete Fix
```
1. Pick customer/events (simplest page)
2. I fix ALL inconsistencies on that page
3. You test thoroughly
4. Next session: Apply same patterns to next page
```

**Why this might fail:**
- Too many changes at once
- Hard to identify what broke
- Might exceed my working memory

### My Optimal Working Pattern

**Best for me:**
```md
Session 1 (Now): 
- Read 2-3 files max
- Make 1-2 small changes
- Create simple todo for you

Session 2 (Tomorrow):
- You tell me what worked/broke
- I fix or continue
- Small increments

Session 3+:
- Pattern established
- Copy working patterns to other pages
```

### What I Should NOT Attempt

❌ **Full system refactor** - I'll lose track
❌ **Complex state management** - Can't test
❌ **Multiple file coordination** - Token limit
❌ **Operator + Customer together** - Too much context

### Realistic Right Now Plan

Let me do ONE thing that's almost guaranteed to work:

```tsx
// 1. Create components/ui/Card.tsx (NEW FILE - can't break anything)
export const Card = ({ children, className = '', ...props }) => (
  <div 
    className={`bg-[var(--bg-secondary)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--border-primary)] p-4 ${className}`} 
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
);

// 2. Update ONE div in customer/events to use it
// 3. If it works, you have a pattern to follow
```

### My Session Management Strategy

**This Session:**
- Fix 1-2 specific things
- Leave clear notes on what I did
- Stop before context gets too large

**Your Part:**
- Test the changes
- Tell me next session: "Card component worked" or "Card component broke because X"
- I continue from there

**Why This Works:**
- Git becomes my memory
- Small changes = easy rollback
- You're my test runner
- Each session is focused

### The Reality Check

**What success looks like:**
- 5-10 small sessions over 2 weeks
- Each session: 1-2 components or 1 page
- Gradually consistent UI
- You can stop anytime with value delivered

**NOT:**
- One massive 3-hour session
- Everything perfect at once
- Me tracking 50 todos

### Right Now Decision

What should I do THIS session?

A. **Create Card component** (safest, 5 mins)
B. **Fix customer/events page** (medium risk, 20 mins)  
C. **Fix operator/tickets page** (you can test immediately, 20 mins)
D. **Just fix the Compete tabs** (specific issue, 10 mins)

I recommend A or D - small, focused, testable.

## My Execution Rules

1. **Max 3 files open** at once
2. **Max 5 todos** at once
3. **One component OR one page** per session
4. **Always leave escape hatch** (old code commented/available)
5. **Stop before 100k tokens** used

## The Brutal Truth

I'm best at:
- Creating isolated new components
- Fixing specific identified issues
- Following patterns you've confirmed work

I'm worst at:
- Large refactors
- Testing my own changes
- Remembering context between sessions
- Complex multi-file coordination

**Let's work with my strengths, not against my limitations.**
