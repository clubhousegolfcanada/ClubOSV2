# ClubOS LLM Routing Audit Report

> **Updated November 2024**: GPT Assistant IDs are now configured in Railway. This document is retained for system architecture reference.

## Executive Summary
The LLM routing system in ClubOS has a sophisticated multi-provider architecture with fallback capabilities. The system is now fully operational with all GPT assistants configured.

## System Architecture

### 1. Route Names & Mapping
The system uses the following route names:
- **Emergency** - For emergencies, injuries, fire, accidents
- **Booking & Access** - For bookings, access issues, door locks, reservations
- **TechSupport** - For technical issues, equipment problems, Trackman issues
- **BrandTone** - For general inquiries, memberships, pricing (default)

### 2. LLM Provider Architecture
```
Request ‚Üí LLMRouter ‚Üí Provider Selection ‚Üí Response
                 ‚Üì
         Priority Order:
         1. OpenAI (priority: 100)
         2. Anthropic (priority: 90)
         3. Local Provider (fallback)
```

## Current Configuration Issues

### 1. Environment Variables ‚úÖ
All GPT Assistant IDs are now configured in Railway:
- `BOOKING_ACCESS_GPT_ID` ‚úÖ
- `EMERGENCY_GPT_ID` ‚úÖ
- `TECH_SUPPORT_GPT_ID` ‚úÖ
- `BRAND_MARKETING_GPT_ID` ‚úÖ

**Status**: The assistant service now uses specialized GPT assistants for each route.

### 2. Route Name Inconsistencies
The system has inconsistent route naming:
- LLM returns: "Booking & Access" (with spaces and ampersand)
- Assistant map expects both old and new formats
- Some places use: "booking", "access", "tech", "brand"

### 3. Authentication Temporarily Disabled üîì
In `/routes/llm.ts`:
```typescript
// authenticate,  // Commented out for demo
// adminOrOperator,  // Commented out for demo
```
**Security Risk**: Anyone can call the LLM endpoints without authentication.

## Data Flow Analysis

### Successful Request Flow:
1. **Frontend** ‚Üí POST `/api/llm/request`
2. **LLM Service** ‚Üí Determines route (Emergency, Booking & Access, etc.)
3. **Assistant Service** ‚Üí Attempts to use GPT assistant for that route
4. **Response** ‚Üí Returns AI-generated response

### Current Fallback Chain:
1. Try OpenAI GPT-4
2. Try Anthropic Claude (if configured)
3. Use Local Provider (keyword-based routing)
4. Return generic fallback message

## Key Findings

### 1. Working Components ‚úÖ
- LLM routing logic is functional
- Multi-provider architecture with fallback
- Local provider for offline/demo mode
- Request logging and metrics

### 2. Recently Fixed ‚úÖ
- GPT Assistant IDs now configured
- Assistant service using specialized responses
- Context injection implemented
- System configuration UI added

### 3. Still Pending ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Authentication disabled on main endpoint (for demo)
- No Anthropic API key configured (optional)
- Slack reply tracking (Phase 2)

### 3. Configuration in Railway
Currently configured:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚úÖ
- `OPENAI_MODEL` ‚úÖ
- `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` ‚úÖ
- `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` ‚úÖ

Missing:
- All GPT Assistant IDs ‚ùå
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` ‚ùå

## Recommendations

### 1. Completed Actions ‚úÖ
1. **GPT Assistant IDs configured in Railway**:
   ```
   BOOKING_ACCESS_GPT_ID=asst_YeWa98dP4Dv0eXwyjMsCHeE7
   EMERGENCY_GPT_ID=asst_xxxxx
   TECH_SUPPORT_GPT_ID=asst_xxxxx
   BRAND_MARKETING_GPT_ID=asst_xxxxx
   ```

2. **Re-enable Authentication**:
   - Uncomment authentication middleware in `/routes/llm.ts`
   - Or add a separate public endpoint for demo purposes

### 2. Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Standardize Route Names**:
   - Use consistent naming across all services
   - Consider using enums for type safety

2. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Track which routes are being used
   - Monitor assistant response times
   - Log fallback frequency

3. **Improve Error Messages**:
   - Provide more specific feedback when assistants aren't configured
   - Add route-specific fallback messages

### 3. Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Add Anthropic Integration**:
   - Configure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for redundancy
   - Test Claude as backup provider

2. **Implement Caching**:
   - Cache common responses
   - Reduce API costs

3. **Add A/B Testing**:
   - Test different models
   - Compare response quality

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Route Testing
- [ ] Test Emergency route detection
- [ ] Test Booking & Access route detection
- [ ] Test TechSupport route detection
- [ ] Test BrandTone (default) route

### 2. Fallback Testing
- [ ] Test with invalid OpenAI key
- [ ] Test with network failure
- [ ] Test with timeout scenarios

### 3. Assistant Testing
- [ ] Configure one assistant ID and test
- [ ] Verify assistant responses are used
- [ ] Check fallback messages work

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Currently disabled - HIGH RISK
2. **API Keys**: Stored securely in Railway ‚úÖ
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented with `strictLimiter` ‚úÖ
4. **Input Validation**: Proper validation in place ‚úÖ

## Performance Metrics

Current configuration:
- Request timeout: 25 seconds
- Retry attempts: 2
- Retry delay: 1000ms
- Max tokens: 500

## Conclusion

The LLM routing system is well-architected and now fully operational. Recent improvements include:
1. All GPT Assistant IDs configured in Railway ‚úÖ
2. Context/memory system implemented ‚úÖ
3. Route naming normalized ‚úÖ
4. System configuration UI added ‚úÖ

The system now provides specialized, context-aware responses through dedicated GPT assistants for each route type. Remaining work includes re-enabling authentication (currently disabled for demo) and implementing Slack reply tracking (Phase 2).
