# Ticket Center Audit & Redesign Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Redesign the Ticket Center to match the structure, functionality, and mobile-friendly design of the Commands and Operations pages.

## 📋 Current State Analysis
- Basic ticket list with filters
- Limited functionality
- Not optimized for mobile
- Lacks the depth of features seen in Operations page

## 🏗️ Proposed Structure

### Main Navigation Tabs (Like Operations)
```
All Tickets | Facilities | Tech Support
```

### Sub-sections Under Each Tab

#### 1. All Tickets Tab (Default)
- **Dashboard View**
  - Quick stats cards (Active, Pending, Resolved Today, SLA Performance)
  - Recent activity feed
  - Priority distribution chart
- **List View**
  - Advanced filtering (date range, priority, assignee, location)
  - Bulk actions
  - Quick status updates
- **Analytics**
  - Resolution time trends
  - Ticket volume by category
  - Performance metrics

#### 2. Facilities Tab
- **Location Management**
  - Bedford, Dartmouth, Stratford, Truro, Bayers Lake
  - Location-specific issues tracker
  - Maintenance schedules
- **Equipment Registry**
  - Simulators
  - Projectors
  - HVAC systems
  - Other facility equipment
- **Preventive Maintenance**
  - Scheduled maintenance calendar
  - Compliance tracking
  - Service history

#### 3. Tech Support Tab
- **Knowledge Base**
  - Common issues & solutions
  - Video guides
  - Troubleshooting flowcharts
- **Remote Support Tools**
  - Quick diagnostic checks
  - Remote access requests
  - Screen sharing integration
- **SOP Management**
  - Tech support procedures
  - Escalation protocols
  - Contact directory

## 🎨 Design Requirements

### Mobile-First Approach
1. **Responsive Grid System**
   - 1 column on mobile
   - 2 columns on tablet
   - 3-4 columns on desktop

2. **Touch-Friendly Elements**
   - Minimum 44px touch targets
   - Swipe gestures for status changes
   - Bottom sheet modals on mobile

3. **Compact Design Elements**
   - Condensed ticket cards
   - Inline actions
   - Collapsible sections
   - Sticky headers

### UI Components to Create/Update
1. **TicketCard** - Compact, mobile-friendly ticket display
2. **TicketFilters** - Advanced filtering with mobile drawer
3. **QuickActions** - Floating action button for mobile
4. **StatusTimeline** - Visual ticket history
5. **PriorityBadge** - Color-coded priority indicators
6. **LocationSelector** - Multi-location filter
7. **AssigneeSelector** - Team member assignment
8. **TicketAnalytics** - Charts and metrics
9. **BulkActionBar** - Multi-select operations
10. **TicketDetail** - Full ticket view with comments

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Features
- Pull-to-refresh
- Offline mode with sync
- Voice-to-text for quick updates
- Camera integration for issue photos
- Push notifications for urgent tickets

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. State Management
```typescript
interface TicketState {
  tickets: Ticket[];
  filters: TicketFilters;
  selectedTab: 'all' | 'facilities' | 'tech';
  selectedTickets: string[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  analytics: TicketAnalytics;
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/tickets` - Paginated ticket list
- `GET /api/tickets/:id` - Single ticket detail
- `PUT /api/tickets/:id` - Update ticket
- `POST /api/tickets/:id/comments` - Add comment
- `GET /api/tickets/analytics` - Analytics data
- `GET /api/facilities/equipment` - Equipment registry
- `GET /api/maintenance/schedule` - Maintenance calendar

### 3. Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add missing fields
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN sla_deadline TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN resolution_time INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN equipment_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN location_id INTEGER;

-- New tables
CREATE TABLE equipment_registry (...);
CREATE TABLE maintenance_schedules (...);
CREATE TABLE ticket_sla_rules (...);
```
