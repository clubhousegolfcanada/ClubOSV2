# SOP Migration Progress Tracker

## Overview
Migrating ClubOS from OpenAI Assistants ($750/month) to local Intelligent SOP Module with zero downtime.

## Progress Summary

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Set up parallel infrastructure without touching current Assistant flow

#### 1.1 Database Setup âœ…
- Created migration file: `011_openphone_sop_system.sql`
- Added tables:
  - `openphone_conversations` - Store OpenPhone webhook data
  - `extracted_knowledge` - Knowledge extracted from conversations
  - `sop_shadow_comparisons` - Compare Assistant vs SOP responses
  - `sop_metrics` - Daily performance metrics
- Migration will run automatically on next deployment

#### 1.2 SOP Directory Structure âœ…
- Created directory structure: `/sops/{booking,emergency,tech,brand}/`
- Copied assistant instructions to `system_instructions.md` in each directory
- Copied knowledge base files from ClubOS Agents folders
- Total files: 16 markdown files organized by category

#### 1.3 OpenPhone Webhook âœ…
- Created `/api/openphone/webhook` endpoint
- Handles message, conversation, and call webhooks
- Stores data in `openphone_conversations` table
- Includes signature verification for security

#### 1.4 Routes Registration âœ…
- Added OpenPhone routes to backend index.ts
- Endpoint available at `/api/openphone/*`

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Knowledge Extraction Service (NEXT)
**Goal**: Build extraction without affecting production

#### 2.1 Knowledge Extractor Service
- TODO: Create `knowledgeExtractor.ts` service
- Extract problem/solution pairs from conversations
- Store in `extracted_knowledge` table

#### 2.2 Admin UI Component
- TODO: Create knowledge extraction panel
- Review and approve extracted knowledge
- Apply knowledge to SOPs

### Phase 3: Intelligent SOP Module Setup
**Goal**: Prepare SOP module in parallel without using it

#### 3.1 Deploy SOP Module
- TODO: Verify `intelligentSOPModule.ts` exists
- Initialize embeddings on startup
- Add status logging

#### 3.2 Feature Flags
- TODO: Add environment variables:
  - `USE_INTELLIGENT_SOP=false`
  - `SOP_SHADOW_MODE=true`
  - `SOP_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75`
  - `OPENPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxx`

### Phase 4: Shadow Mode Testing
**Goal**: Run both systems in parallel, log differences

### Phase 5: Gradual Rollout
**Goal**: Switch traffic progressively (10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)

### Phase 6: Complete Migration
**Goal**: Fully replace Assistants

## Environment Variables Needed

Add these to Railway/Vercel:
```
# OpenPhone Integration
OPENPHONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here

# SOP Feature Flags (start with these values)
USE_INTELLIGENT_SOP=false
SOP_SHADOW_MODE=false
SOP_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
SOP_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy current changes** to get database migrations running
2. **Configure OpenPhone webhook** in OpenPhone dashboard to point to your Railway URL
3. **Continue with Phase 2** - Knowledge extraction service

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] SOP directories created with all files
- [ ] OpenPhone webhook receives test data
- [ ] No impact on current Assistant functionality

## Notes

- All changes are behind feature flags - zero risk to production
- OpenPhone webhook is independent - won't affect current flow
- SOP files are copies - originals remain untouched
- Database changes are additive only - no modifications to existing tables
