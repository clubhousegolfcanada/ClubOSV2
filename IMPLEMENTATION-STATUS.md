# Knowledge System Implementation Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Created comprehensive implementation plan
- [x] Designed ultra-flexible storage schema
- [x] Built database migration (054_knowledge_store.sql)
- [x] Implemented KnowledgeStore service class
- [x] Created API endpoints for CRUD operations
- [x] Added file parser for .md/.json/.txt
- [x] Built unified knowledge search service
- [x] Fixed TypeScript build errors
- [x] Committed and pushed to production

### What's Working:
1. **Database Schema**: Ready to deploy - will create 3 tables:
   - `knowledge_store` - Main flexible storage
   - `knowledge_patterns` - Pattern detection
   - `knowledge_extraction_log` - Audit trail

2. **API Endpoints**: Ready at `/api/knowledge-store/`
   - POST `/set` - Store knowledge
   - GET `/get/:key` - Retrieve by key
   - GET `/search?q=` - Search all knowledge
   - DELETE `/:key` - Delete knowledge
   - POST `/upload` - Upload files
   - GET `/analytics` - Usage stats

3. **File Upload**: Supports:
   - `.json` - Key-value pairs
   - `.md` - Markdown with headers
   - `.txt` - Q&A or key-value format

4. **Search**: Full-text search with:
   - Confidence scoring
   - Usage tracking
   - Relevance ranking

## 🔄 Phase 2: Deployment & Testing (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Deploy migration to Railway
- [ ] Test API with production database
- [ ] Verify knowledge storage works
- [ ] Test search functionality

## 📋 Phase 3: UI Simplification (NEXT)
- [ ] Simplify operations/knowledge page
- [ ] Remove old SOP sections
- [ ] Add simple Add/Edit/Delete UI
- [ ] Connect to new API endpoints
- [ ] Add file upload UI

## 🔗 Phase 4: Connect to AI (PENDING)
- [ ] Update dashboard to check local first
- [ ] Connect to AI automations
- [ ] Test gift card automation
- [ ] Test trackman automation

## 🧠 Phase 5: Intelligence (PENDING)
- [ ] Implement conversation extraction
- [ ] Add pattern detection
- [ ] Build deduplication logic
- [ ] Create confidence scoring

## 📊 Phase 6: Admin Tools (PENDING)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Knowledge health monitoring
- [ ] Conflict resolution tools
- [ ] Bulk operations

## Current Blockers:
1. **Railway Deployment**: Waiting for build to complete
2. **Database Connection**: Need production DB for testing
3. **OpenAI Key**: Not set locally (not critical for storage)

## Next Immediate Actions:
1. **Monitor Railway deployment** - Should auto-run migration
2. **Test with production API** once deployed
3. **Start UI simplification** if deployment successful

## Success Metrics:
- [ ] Can store knowledge via API
- [ ] Can search and retrieve knowledge
- [ ] Response time < 100ms for cached queries
- [ ] Gift card URL returned from local storage
- [ ] 90% reduction in OpenAI calls

## Testing Commands:
```bash
# Once deployed to Railway, test:

# 1. Store knowledge
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url/api/knowledge-store/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"key":"giftcard.url","value":"https://clubhouse247golf.com/giftcard"}'

# 2. Search knowledge
curl "https://your-railway-url/api/knowledge-store/search?q=gift%20card"

# 3. Get specific key
curl "https://your-railway-url/api/knowledge-store/get/giftcard.url"
```

## Architecture Summary:
```
User Input → Knowledge Store API → PostgreSQL JSONB
                                       ↓
Dashboard Query → Search Local → Found? Return : Query OpenAI
                                       ↓
OpenPhone Message → Extract → Store → Deduplicate
```

## Risk Assessment:
- ✅ **Low Risk**: All changes additive, won't break existing
- ⚠️ **Medium Risk**: Need to ensure migration runs properly
- ✅ **Mitigation**: Can rollback if issues

## Timeline:
- **Day 1-2**: ✅ Foundation (COMPLETE)
- **Day 3**: Testing & UI
- **Day 4-5**: AI Integration
- **Day 6-7**: Intelligence Layer
- **Day 8-10**: Polish & Deploy

## Notes:
- System designed to be ultra-flexible (Winston-style)
- Can store anything from URLs to complex procedures
- Full-text search across all content
- Automatic confidence scoring and usage tracking
- File upload support for bulk imports
