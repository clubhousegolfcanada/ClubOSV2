# NinjaOne Integration - Deep Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Focused implementation for PC/software restarts only (no music/TV systems). The integration allows operators to remotely restart TrackMan software, browsers, or perform full PC reboots across all Clubhouse 24/7 Golf locations.

## Scope Reduction
- ❌ ~~Music system restarts~~ (removed)
- ❌ ~~TV system restarts~~ (removed)  
- ✅ TrackMan software restart
- ✅ Browser restart with tournament display
- ✅ Full PC reboot
- ✅ Combined software restart (TrackMan + Browser)

## File Structure Analysis

### 1. Backend Files Created/Modified

#### ✅ `/src/routes/remoteActions.ts`
- **Status**: Already exists
- **Issue**: Import path incorrect (`../db` should be `../utils/db`)
- **Fix**: Use corrected version in `remoteActions-simplified.ts`

#### ✅ `/src/services/ninjaone.ts`
- **Status**: Already exists
- **Dependencies**: Requires `axios` (may not be installed)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 client credentials flow implemented

#### ⚠️ `/src/index.ts`
- **Status**: Modified to include route
- **Issue**: Need to verify route is actually mounted

#### ✅ `/src/database/migrations/007_remote_actions.sql`
- **Status**: Created
- **Purpose**: Logging table for all remote actions

### 2. Frontend Files

#### ❌ `/src/api/remoteActions.ts`
- **Status**: MISSING
- **Impact**: Frontend cannot call backend API
- **Fix**: Must be created

#### ✅ `/src/pages/commands.tsx`
- **Status**: Updated with execute functions
- **Issue**: API client import missing

### 3. PowerShell Scripts (Simplified)

#### Simplified to 4 core scripts:
1. `Restart-TrackMan-Simple.ps1` - Software only
2. `Restart-Browser-Simple.ps1` - Browser with kiosk mode
3. `Reboot-SimulatorPC.ps1` - Full PC restart
4. `Restart-All-Software.ps1` - Combined restart

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing Axios Dependency
```bash
cd ClubOSV1-backend
npm install axios
```

### 2. Database Import Path
```typescript
// WRONG
import { pool } from '../db';

// CORRECT
import { pool } from '../utils/db';
```

### 3. Missing Frontend API Client
Must create `/ClubOSV1-frontend/src/api/remoteActions.ts`

### 4. Environment Variables Not Set
```bash
# Required in Railway
NINJAONE_CLIENT_ID=
NINJAONE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NINJAONE_BASE_URL=https://api.ninjarmm.com
```

## Security Audit

### ✅ Implemented Controls
1. **Role-based access**: `requireRole('operator')` enforced
2. **Authentication**: JWT token required
3. **Device validation**: Strict mapping prevents unauthorized access
4. **Audit logging**: All actions logged to database
5. **Slack notifications**: Real-time alerts for critical actions

### ⚠️ Potential Vulnerabilities
1. **Rate limiting**: Not specifically implemented for remote actions endpoint
2. **Device IDs**: Currently placeholder values - must be updated with real IDs
3. **Script injection**: Parameters passed to PowerShell need validation
4. **Timeout handling**: No maximum execution time enforced

## Implementation Risks

### 1. Database Migration
- **Risk**: Table creation may fail if migration not run
- **Mitigation**: Backend handles missing table gracefully in demo mode

### 2. Network Connectivity
- **Risk**: NinjaOne API may be unreachable
- **Mitigation**: Timeout settings in axios, graceful error handling

### 3. PowerShell Execution
- **Risk**: Scripts may hang or fail silently
- **Mitigation**: Exit codes implemented, timeout in NinjaOne

### 4. User Experience
- **Risk**: Actions may take longer than expected
- **Mitigation**: Status polling, estimated time display

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Backend Setup (Day 1)
1. Install axios: `npm install axios`
2. Fix database import in remoteActions.ts
3. Deploy backend with demo mode
4. Test simulated actions

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Day 2)
1. Create frontend API client
2. Test UI with simulated backend
3. Verify role-based access works
4. Test error handling

### Phase 3: NinjaOne Setup (Day 3-4)
1. Upload PowerShell scripts to NinjaOne
2. Get device IDs from NinjaOne dashboard
3. Get script IDs after upload
4. Update mapping in backend

### Phase 4: Production Testing (Day 5)
1. Add NinjaOne credentials to Railway
2. Test with one location (Bedford)
3. Monitor logs and Slack alerts
4. Roll out to other locations

## File Cleanup Needed

### Remove/Archive:
- Original complex remoteActions.ts (has music/TV)
- Complex PowerShell scripts (music/TV systems)
- Unused "other" action handlers

### Keep:
- Simplified remoteActions.ts (PC only)
- 4 core PowerShell scripts
- Database migration
- NinjaOne service

## Performance Considerations

### API Calls
- NinjaOne rate limits: Unknown (need to verify)
- Token caching: 5 minutes before expiry
- Device status checks: Could be cached

### Database
- Indexes created on commonly queried fields
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling configured

### Frontend
- Status polling: 5-second intervals
- Maximum poll duration: 2 minutes
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Slack Channels
- `#tech-alerts`: Critical actions (reboots)
- `#tech-actions-log`: Regular actions
- Consider: `#ninjaone-errors` for failures

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Recent actions
SELECT * FROM remote_actions_log 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Failed actions
SELECT * FROM remote_actions_log 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Actions by user
SELECT initiated_by, COUNT(*) as action_count 
FROM remote_actions_log 
GROUP BY initiated_by 
ORDER BY action_count DESC;
```

## Cost Considerations

### NinjaOne Licensing
- Per-device licensing model
- Need ~20 devices across all locations
- Script execution included in base license?

### Infrastructure
- Minimal additional load on backend
- PostgreSQL storage: ~1KB per action
- Slack API: Well within free tier

## Final Recommendations

1. **Start with demo mode** - Test everything without NinjaOne
2. **Implement gradually** - One location at a time
3. **Monitor closely** - Watch logs during initial rollout
4. **Document device IDs** - Create mapping spreadsheet
5. **Train operators** - Clear guidelines on when to use
6. **Set expectations** - Reboots take 3-5 minutes
7. **Have rollback plan** - Can disable via environment variable

## Questions for IT Team

1. What are the actual NinjaOne device IDs?
2. Is there a NinjaOne rate limit we should respect?
3. Should we add approval workflow for PC reboots?
4. Which Slack channel for non-critical logs?
5. Any specific PowerShell execution policies?
6. Backup method if NinjaOne is down?

## Conclusion

The implementation is 80% complete but has critical missing pieces:
- Frontend API client
- Axios dependency
- Real device/script IDs
- Environment variables

With these fixes, the system can be operational in demo mode immediately and production-ready within a week.
