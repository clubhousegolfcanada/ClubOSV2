## [1.24.31] - 2025-10-27

### üöÄ Booking System - Create Button Now Fully Functional

#### Issues Fixed
- **Create Button Did Nothing**: The Create button in the booking navigation was completely unresponsive due to SSR bug
- **SSR Window Access Error**: SubNavigation component was accessing `window.innerWidth` during server-side rendering
- **Modal Required Selection**: Booking modal wouldn't open without a pre-selected time slot
- **Default to Legacy**: System was defaulting to Skedda iframe instead of ClubOS native booking

#### Implementation Changes
- **Fixed SSR Bug**: SubNavigation now uses `isMobile` state instead of directly accessing `window` object (lines 122, 149)
- **Create Button Handler**: Changed from showing notification to directly opening booking modal with `setShowCreateBooking(true)`
- **Smart Defaults**: Modal now provides intelligent defaults when no time slot is selected:
  - Start time: Next available hour
  - Duration: 1 hour default
  - Space: Box 1 (first simulator)
  - Location: Currently selected location
- **Default System**: Changed `showLegacySystem` from `true` to `false` to default to ClubOS

#### Results
- ‚úÖ Create button immediately opens booking modal
- ‚úÖ Users can click Create OR drag on calendar to book
- ‚úÖ No more "button does nothing" confusion
- ‚úÖ Server-side rendering works properly
- ‚úÖ ClubOS booking system is now the default view

## [1.24.30] - 2025-10-27

### üö® Critical Fix - Backend TypeScript Compilation Failure

#### Issue Identified
- **Duplicate Export Error**: The v1.24.29 commit still contained a duplicate DbBooking export in database.ts
- **Impact**: Backend failed to compile with TypeScript error "Multiple exports with the same name 'DbBooking'"
- **Root Cause**: Both importing and re-exporting DbBooking in the same file (database.ts lines 8 and 14)

#### Fixed Issues
- **Removed duplicate export**: Deleted the re-export of DbBooking from database.ts
- **Updated imports**: Modified transformers.ts to import DbBooking directly from '../types/booking'
- **Added clarifying comment**: Documented that DbBooking should be imported from types/booking

#### Results
- ‚úÖ Backend compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Booking modal now opens when clicking "Continue" after selecting time slot
- ‚úÖ Production deployment will succeed without compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Centralized type imports prevent future duplication issues

- **Result**: Fits more simulators than Skedda while maintaining readability

## [1.24.4] - 2025-10-22

### üîß Fix Customer Login Token Issue

  - Solution: Removed all manual token checks - http client handles auth automatically
  - Simplified compete.tsx and CustomerDashboard.tsx by removing tokenManager dependencies
  - Result: Customer login now works correctly without redirect loops

## [1.24.3] - 2025-10-22

### üîß Booking System Debug & Critical Fix
- **Fixed Critical Backend Bug**: ORDER BY clause was hardcoded to use b.start_at
  - Found the real issue: ORDER BY wasn't defensive like the rest of the query
