# âœ… RBAC Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across ClubOSV1 with a three-tier role hierarchy: admin > operator > support.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
1. **Role Types & JWT**
   - Added `UserRole` enum with three roles
   - Updated JWT payload to include role
   - Default role: `operator` for authenticated users

2. **Role Guard Middleware**
   - Created `roleGuard.ts` middleware
   - Validates user roles against allowed roles
   - Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

3. **Protected Routes**
   - `/api/access/unlock` - Admin only
   - `/api/llm/request` - Admin & Operator
   - `/api/bookings/*` - All authenticated users
   - `/api/slack/message` - All authenticated users

4. **Tests**
   - Comprehensive Jest unit tests for role guard
   - Tests cover all role scenarios and edge cases

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
1. **Role State Management**
   - Added role to Zustand store
   - Persist role in localStorage
   - Auto-initialize from stored JWT

2. **UI Components**
   - **RoleTag**: Displays current user role with color coding
   - **Navigation**: Shows/hides features based on role
   - **RequestForm**: Disables unauthorized LLM routes with lock icon
   - **RoleSwitcher**: Development tool for testing roles

3. **Role Utilities**
   - `hasRole()`: Check if user has required role
   - `isRouteAuthorized()`: Check route permissions
   - `getRoleColor()`: Get role-specific styling

4. **Visual Indicators**
   - ðŸ”’ Lock icon for restricted features
   - Tooltips explaining access requirements
   - Color-coded role badges
   - Disabled states with clear messaging

## Usage Examples

### Backend Route Protection
```typescript
router.post('/admin-only', 
  authenticate, 
  roleGuard(['admin']), 
  controller
);
```

### Frontend Role Check
```typescript
const canUnlock = hasRole(user?.role, ['admin']);
if (canUnlock) {
  // Show unlock button
}
```

### Testing Different Roles
1. Use the role switcher in development
2. Or manually set role in localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('user_role', 'admin');
```

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
2. Test each role manually using the role switcher
3. Verify API endpoints return 403 for unauthorized access
4. Consider adding role-based dashboards
5. Implement audit logging for role-based actions

## Security Notes
- Roles are enforced on both frontend and backend
- Frontend checks are for UX only - security is backend-enforced
- JWTs expire after 24 hours
- Role changes require re-authentication
