## Next Steps - HubSpot Configuration

### Step 1: Generate Webhook Secret
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# Example output: a3f2d8e9c1b5a7d3e9f2c8b4a6d2e8f4c1b3a5d7e9f1c3b5a7d9e1f3c5b7a9d1
```

### Step 2: Add to Railway Environment
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your backend service
3. Variables tab
4. Add:
   - `HUBSPOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = (value from step 1)
   - `BOOKING_REWARD_AMOUNT` = 25
   - `BOOKING_REWARD_DELAY_DAYS` = 7

### Step 3: Configure HubSpot Webhooks
**Webhook URLs for your Railway app:**
- Completed: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed`
- Updates: `https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-updated`

**In HubSpot:**
1. Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
2. Create/Edit "ClubOS Integration"
3. Webhooks tab → Create subscription
4. Object: Deal, Event: Property change, Property: dealstage
5. Set webhook URL and secret

### Step 4: Test Webhook
```bash
# Test with curl (replace with your actual Railway URL)
curl -X POST https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/hubspot/booking-completed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-HubSpot-Signature: test" \
  -d '[{
    "objectId": "test-deal-123",
    "properties": {
      "dealstage": "closedwon",
      "booking_date": "2025-08-23",
      "location": "Bedford",
      "box_number": "2"
    }
  }]'
```

### Step 5: Monitor Rewards
```bash
# Check pending rewards (need auth token)
curl https://clubosv1-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-rewards/pending \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

## System Architecture

```
HubSpot Deal → Webhook → ClubOS Backend → Queue Reward (7 days)
                                         ↓
                              Hourly Job → Process Due Rewards
                                         ↓
                              Award 25 CC → Update cc_balance
                                         ↓
                              Log Transaction → cc_transactions
```

## Known Limitations
1. Users must have ClubOS account before booking to receive rewards
2. Manual HubSpot contact ID linking may be needed for some users
3. Rewards are non-refundable once awarded

## Security Features
- Webhook signature verification (when secret configured)
- Idempotent operations (can't double-award)
- Complete audit trail
- Admin-only manual controls
- Rate limiting on webhook endpoints

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- Check `/api/admin/booking-rewards/stats` weekly
- Review failed rewards for manual processing
- Monitor cc_transactions for unusual patterns
- Verify HubSpot webhook delivery logs

## Success Metrics
- Webhook receipt rate: Should be 100% of completed bookings
- Processing success rate: Target >95%
- Reward delivery time: Within 1 hour of due date
- User satisfaction: Monitor for questions about missing rewards

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Disable webhook in HubSpot
2. Stop job: Remove from index.ts
3. Manual awards still possible via admin endpoint
4. All rewards tracked in database for reconciliation

## Conclusion
✅ **System is FULLY OPERATIONAL and ready for HubSpot webhook configuration**

The booking rewards system is successfully deployed and waiting for HubSpot webhooks to start receiving booking completions. Once configured, customers will automatically receive 25 ClubCoins 7 days after their booking.
