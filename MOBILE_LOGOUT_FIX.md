## Commit Instructions

```bash
cd "/Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse OS (Root)/CLUBOSV1"

# Add the changes

git commit -m "fix: Improve mobile logout button visibility

- Increased mobile menu max height to 600px
- Added logout icon to mobile logout button

The logout button was already there but might have been cut off by the height constraint or hard to find. These changes make it more visible and accessible!
