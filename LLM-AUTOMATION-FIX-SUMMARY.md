# LLM Automation Fix Summary

## The Problem
The LLM automation wasn't working even though API keys and Assistant IDs were configured in Railway. The issue was a **timing problem**: the `assistantService` was being instantiated at module load time, BEFORE Railway's environment variables were available.

## Evidence Found
1. Comment in code: "Use process.env directly instead of config to avoid timing issues with Railway"
2. Service instantiation happened immediately when module loaded
3. At that point, `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` was undefined
4. Service would initialize with `isEnabled = false` and never retry

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Enabled LLM Initial Analysis (Migration 043)
```sql
UPDATE ai_automation_features 
SET enabled = true
WHERE feature_key = 'llm_initial_analysis';
```

### 2. Made AssistantService Lazy-Loaded
Changed from immediate instantiation to a Proxy that initializes on first use:
- Service now initializes when first message arrives
- By then, Railway environment variables are loaded
- Added detailed logging to show what's available

### 3. What Happens Now
1. OpenPhone message arrives â†’ webhook triggered
2. AI automation service checks if initial message analysis is enabled
3. On first use, assistantService lazy-loads with proper env vars
4. LLM analyzes message (GPT-4o-mini)
5. If automation appropriate, queries the right OpenAI Assistant
6. Response sent back via OpenPhone

## To Deploy
1. Commit and push these changes:
   - Migration 043 (enables LLM analysis)
   - Updated assistantService.ts (lazy loading fix)
2. Monitor logs for: "Lazy-initializing AssistantService"
3. Should see API key and assistant IDs properly loaded

## Expected Log Output
```
Lazy-initializing AssistantService {
  hasApiKey: true,
  apiKeyPrefix: "sk-proj-xx...",
  hasBookingAssistant: true,
  hasEmergencyAssistant: true,
  hasTechAssistant: true,
  hasBrandAssistant: true
}
```

## Why It Never Worked Before
The service was checking for API keys too early in the startup process. Railway loads environment variables asynchronously, so by the time they were available, the service had already decided they didn't exist and disabled itself permanently.
